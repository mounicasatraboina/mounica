This Guidance goes against the plain language of the 2009 FDA Law and creates a dangerous loophole in the restrictions on sampling.

Cigars, little cigars and pipe tobacco are all tobacco products and they are all associated with increased risk of oral, lung, and other cancers and all produce second hand somke which pollutes the environment and exposes unwilling others to negative health effects.Current regulations clearly prohibit the sampling of these items, and the FDA should not interpret the regulations in any other way.

My stores are open from 8:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. on weekdays and similar hours on the weekends for a total of almost 80 business hours per week. If I had to post an employee at the door of each of my stores, I would need to hire two employees each working about 40 hours per week. At an hourly wage of $8.00 per hour plus employer taxes and benefits, that would come to over $18,000 per employee per year which means the extra cost would be greater than $36,000 per store or $288,000 for all eight stores.There are other ways to ensure that minors are not present in my stores without forcing me to hire new employees and incur substantial employee salary and benefit costs. FDA staff members need to understand that from a practical experience point of view, minors do not walk into Blue Ridge Tobacco stores on their own. That is because we have two different signs on the door warning the public that anyone under 18 is not allowed and that all customers 27 years old or younger must present valid ID.

FDA-2010-N-0136,FDA-2010-N-0136-0002,"( FDA2010-N-0136)While the first amendment certainly guarantees the freedom of press, restrictions are appropriate when life-threatening products are the subject of advertisement. Tobacco companies must be forced to advertise to their potential consumers. I am in agreement that billboards should not be within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, and I would further propose that it not be within that proximity to any level of public school. One might argue that teachers, staff, and parents are potential consumers, but I would combat that argument with the fact that the majority of the population of a school is not eligible to purchase tobacco products. The Bill of Rights promotes personal liberties, but it also promotes lawfulness. It is unfair to tempt underage citizens to break the law. Smaller ads should also be prohibited from being located within 1,000 feet of any public school. I feel that regardless of the size of the ad, students will notice. Once students are of legal age they may decide to purchase and use tobacco products. Our country allows it's citizens many personal liberties and the right to use tobacco is one of them. I have no issue with tobacco companies advertising their products, but they should be regulated in a manner that forces them to advertise to consumers that meet legal requirements for purchase.",advertisement,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
FDA-2010-N-0136,FDA-2010-N-0136-0003,"The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control ActThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) is a great start on a problem that should have corrected long ago. Just by the fact that the U.S. continues to allow the smoking industry to operate the way that it does is an insult to all taxpayers. I recently knew a man who passed away from lung cancer as a result of 20+ years of smoking. While he was a friend of mine I was infuriated that he had absolutely no insurance thus the hospital had to pick up the bill and from there the taxpayers in my city had to pay for. Not to mention the passing of the new healthcare reform bill. Personally I feel that advertising for tobacco industries should be severed from public view, on top of that smokers should be limited to where they can smoke to prevent people like myself or an adolescent from inhaling the toxic fumes. Why should the non-smokers have to pay for advertising for tobacco industries or worse their medical bills?

FDA-2010-N-0136,FDA-2010-N-0136-0004,"I agree that restrictions should be placed on tobacco advertisements. According to the CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2000) â€œregulating advertising and promotion, particularly which directed at young people, is very likely to reduce both the prevalence and initiation of smoking.â€ I am for the current age restrictions to purchase tobacco products. However, further restrictions can possibly lower the number of tobacco users. Advertisements for tobacco products persuade consumers to purchase products that can potentially be life threatening. â€œOn average, during 2000â€“2004 smoking accounted for an estimated 3.1 million years of potential life lost for males and 2 million years of potential life lost for females annually, excluding deaths from residential fires and adult deaths from secondhand smoke,â€ (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 2009). Tobacco doesnâ€™t only affect those people that use the product; it can affect those that are around the product as well. Second hand smoke is very dangerous. Laws forbidding smoking in restaurants is a great regulation and should be carried out nationwide. It is on a person to decide for themselves whether or not they would like to use tobacco. However, it is not up to them to decide for other and that is why those regulations, and this proposal, are very important. References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2000).

The youth of America must be protected from advertisement strategies which draw future voters into the dilemma of developing a widely known fatal habit. As developed by Marc C.

Recent reviews by the United States Institute of Medicine ([3]), the United States Department of Health and Human Services ([4]) and the World Health Organization ([5]) reached the same conclusionIn order to ensure the regulation will not violate the First Amendment because it is not adequately tailored to achieve the substantial state interest of protecting children and adolescents from tobacco products, the FDA must pursue the total ban of outdoor advertisement since it is statistically shown to reduce tobacco consumption by up to 9%.(http://www.globalink.org/en/advertising.shtml)Since it seems the tobacco companies will somehow throw enough money around in court in order to avoid such a crippling business regulation, it would be in the best interest of the United States government to empower cities to deal locally with violations of outdoor ad regulations.

My opinion on this subject is that if one was to prohibit tobacco advertisements within 1,000 feet of any elementary or secondary school, you might as well prohibit all advertising. If we are honestly looking out for the health of our youth then all fast food billboards, alcohol billboards, tobacco billboards, as well as junk food billboards would all have to be banned. A few things came to mind when reading this proposed rule. The first thing that came into mind was how this rule could be seen as violating the First Amendment. Another thought that came to mind is why there is so much focus on limiting the advertisement of the product to minors and not the enforcement of the laws that restrict anyone under the age of 18 from smoking or using tobacco products.The purpose for advertisements is to catch the attention and interests of the consumer so that they want to buy the product. What advertising firms do in those advertisements to catch the attention of consumers can be another subject all together in regards to deceptive and misleading advertising. The point is, the advertisement is meant to get your attention. One could assume that billboard advertisements are meant for motorist, the majority being over 18, the legal age to smoke. To limit the location of an advertisement because a small portion of the wrong market segment might see it does not make sense. You can not hide certain product or items from children forever, they will either see it at home, on television, the internet, or from peers.

If smokers have diseased lungs, alcoholics have diseased livers.

Why is this? It is because smoking is addictive. We should not rely on guilt-inducing tactics to break people of their smoking addiction, we should instead offer them resources and information to seek help to find freedom from tobacco dependency.

Although smoking is a choice and it's every person's right to exercise that choice, as adults they will be fully reminded of the potential and/or ultimate consequences of their decision to smoke everytime they reach for a cigarette. I do think that the same warning information should be put on chewing tobacco, snuff, cigars, and pipe tobacco. The use of these products also cause cancer of the mouth and throat and have been linked to other cancers in the body. I don't believe in the myth of capitalism but I do think it's ridiculous when someone can sue a tobacco company when they get cancer from smoking the company's product. When injuires are self-inflicted by stupidity and/or a sense of omnipotence there certainly should be no lawsuit. Put the warnings out there and the adults that continue to puff, puff, puff themselves to death can be considered informed. These types of poor health choices and behaviors by adults have contributed to the unneccessary burden of particular chronic diseases to our health care system.

Many people know that smoking in general causes health risks, but it is important to emphasize these specific dangerous, such as cancer, CHD, or COPD. One possibility is to advertise the affects of smoking on certain body organs or systems. Also, displaying advertisments that focus on certain cancers and diseases is much better than just stating that smoking can kill you.Many smokers already know that smoking has many health risks, but detailing these risks in visuals can be beneficial.

Because of all the facts we know today of how smoking is so harmful, people should be well aware of what they are putting in their bodies when they smoke. The labels that are currently on cigarette packets don't have near as many as the hash chemicals that are actually in each cigarette. Users most likely do not know that there are 43 chemicals in a cigarette that cause caner alone, not counting many others that may not cause cancer. Chemicals like Acetone, Ammonia, Lighter fluid, Industrial solvent, Carbon monoxide, Benzopyrene and urethane which are carcinogens that directly cause cancer, and Formaldehyde a cocarcinogen that when combined with other chemicals can cause cancer. The long term effects of smoking could be the possibility of getting cardiovasuclar disease, the number one killer of women in America, lung cancer, or even ochronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each of these diseases can and will most likely result in death. There are many not as serious illnesses that come from smoking over a period of time and although they may not result in death, they make life very difficult and uneasy because they make people very sick. The importance of people knowing what is in a single cigarette could not be higher because if a new smoker reads a label, sees all of the harsh things that are in cigarettes, it could cause that person to not smoke that cigarette which would then be one less smoker added to the deadly list of people who smoke.",Chemicals,Positive,Positive,Positive

However, as a human and more specifically, as a woman, the image of a woman dying as a result of smoking was very real, terrifying, and dramatic.

I sincerely hope that these graphic, color photographs of the effects of long-term smoking are successful in decreasing the number of people who consume (are addicted to) cigarettes.Furthermore, I feel that the FDA should continue to come up with stricter and harsher regulations on tobacco companies.

The more regulations the FDA can impose on them, the better.I thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion on this proposed regulation and I hope that it goes into effect soon to slow down the societal damage that cigarettes have caused for decades now.Sincerely,JoshUS Navy","warning, graphic",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

The belief that I carried that our nation had turned the tide within healthcare has been tainted. Other countries have been successful with fear as a method to turn behavior, but we are not those countries. We have the ability to understand and respect the difficulties of addiction and isolate the disease process and treatments. We are have the ability to understand respectful care, both for the provider and the patient. We understand destructive behaviors and we are strong enough to identify and turn away from them...even with the facade of success. We have the ability to use critical thinking to see beyond the immediate and out into our peripheral view to others who will be touched. We have the creative minds to step past our uncomfortable past and move into practice that does not devalue one for the sake of another. What I chose not to believe is true. Beyond the horrors of the disease process, my son has lost dreams and friends. He shares that he will have perfect attendance in school so that no future employer will ever know that he had cancer.

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0287,"We all know that tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Despite increasing amounts of scientific evidence describing its detrimental effects, Americans continue to smoke. Youth aged 12 to 17 years are at particular risk associated with tobacco use. Our organization, Smokeless Social Media a subcommittee of MWPHA, is concerned about the prevalence of unregulated tobacco advertisement on new media forms, such as Facebook. We would like to see a requirement that all sites on the internet that show photographs of tobacco packaging must conform to the new FDA warnings and graphics. Although many sites have Terms of Service policies in regard to tobacco, these policies go unenforced, particularly when it concerns restrictions on underage users. Smokeless Social Media is greatly concerned with this fact. A search of Facebook reveals numerous tobacco related product pages which encourage the use of these products. These pages fail to provide any age restriction to prevent minors from negative influence. The branded tobacco presence is either being perpetuated by third-party users or tobacco companies. Either way, the Facebook Corporation is negligent in restricting minor access to these adult product pages. By not doing so, they are failing to enforce their own Terms of Service and are in fact endorsing tobacco. When underage Facebook users join tobacco related pages, they inadvertently become brand advocates of tobacco. In order reduce or remove the branded tobacco presence on such a widely used social networking site as Facebook, or any other internet site with a tobacco presence, current policies restricting such a presence must be enforced. By requiring the new graphic warnings it would restrict the branded tobacco presence on the internet with youth access. Smokeless Social Media is also asking that restrictions on youth access to Internet tobacco sites and Facebook sites with a tobacco presence be enforced.","detrimental effects, youth",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0288,"Everyone has heard the sayings that a picture is worth a thousand words. I believe that is the main point behind this proposal for required warnings for cigarette packages and advertisements. You would be surprised at the number of individuals that purchase goods and products and do not take the time to read the warnings on the labels. However, those same individuals could probably describe the colors and images used on the package. This is why I support this new regulation. This regulation would require cigarette packages not only have nine new textual warnings statements, but would also require a color graphic depicting the negative health consequences. Presented with the images, the consumer would be forced to mentally acknowledge the possible consequences and hopefully cause them to think twice about what they are doing to their body. According to the American Cancer Society, 20% of high school students were smoking cigarettes in 2009. A good majority of them probably fell prey to peer pressure and did not fully understand the dangers of it. Even though there are commercials on TV, websites, and brochures in store, people do not always take the time to read them or fully digest the information. Graphics, especially colored graphics, can catch attention and relay a message much easier and more effectively than words. The warnings on cigarette packages have not really changed in the last 25 years. While incorporating graphics may not drastically affect those who are already addicted to cigarettes, I do believe that it could prevent youth from experimenting with smoking.

First I would like to question the effectiveness of this rule and propose an item that may be more helpful in keeping people from picking up cigarettes. I fail to see the effectiveness of adding these new items to cigarette packs. It seems these labels are being added to prevent smoking, or to aid in the decision that will keep teens from picking up tobacco and becoming addicted. This proposal fails to address a couple critical issues. First, everybody already knows that tobacco is bad for them. That is hammered into us at a very young age. Second, you are trying to cut the use of the before mentioned product by â€œscaringâ€ a contingent of individuals that really do not care about health. Meaning teens are not concerned with their daily intake of items, whether it is food, drink or tobacco. Bottom line is this; you are pushing to increase advertisement about a productâ€™s health risks, to a group of individuals that believe they are still immortal. It is completely ineffective. A better area to focus on would be to get the parents involved with their childâ€™s life and stricter restrictions on minors. A caring parent is one of the key ingredients that will help to prevent the use of tobacco by minors, not adding labels that just tend to become the topic of jokes in bars and at college parties. Second, I fail to see many instances of people getting in trouble for using tobacco at a young age. Maybe it is time to increase the fines for people who purchase these products for minors.

Additionally, any entity that receives government funding or assistance would have a ban. Ban it from any business that receives assistance in any form from the government. Ban it from anyone receiving government assistance. This would, in a sense, limit most smoking to residences, and only those not receiving any assistance such as welfare or tax breaks. Lastly, ban nicotine in cigarettes. Mandating pictures will not deter. People who smoke will continue to because they are not sick yet.

Many smokers know that they are at risk for lung, throat, and mouth cancer, but most do not know of the link between smoking and bladder cancer. By adding â€œbladder cancerâ€ to this label, the FDA will alert smokers to the fact that they have are at significant risk for this often overlooked and under-recognized cancer.My Husband passed away 2 yrs ago from bladder cancer. He had smoked for 9 yrs and had quit over 20 yrs ago. Yet, it was felt that his bladder cancer was from the smoking. Before he passed away, I told him that I would volunteer to help educate people about bladder cancer. I have volunteered with BCAN since his death. When I greet him in heaven, I want to be able to tell him that there is a cure for bladder cancer.",cancer,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Since it is important that the consumer fully acknowledges the risks of smoking before partaking in the activity, current labels need to be reformed to be more visible, and less vague.However, the current problems of cigarette warning labels are not solved by the color graphics of the Tobacco Control Act because, although they are more visible, they rely on the same ambiguousness as their predecessor. The slogans that are health related do not provide the statistics of their featured illness. To say that â€œcigarettes cause cancerâ€ without saying how often cigarettes cause cancer causes the consumer to presume that cancer results from smoking 100% of the time. This kind of statement is an overstatement of a convincing argument not to smoke, and is guilty of providing false information. Not only do the proposed labels lack the necessary facts, but they use pathos in a way similar to propaganda to fuse unrelated negative ideas to the concept of smoking. Ideas like unpleasantness, a loss of autonomy, and even bad parenting are represented in the images. These ideas, though in opinion may be linked with smoking, do not contain the factual information that needs to be understood in making an informed decision. My proposal is that we use these graphic images to present factual information that is required for consumers to make an informed choice about smoking. Statistics of how frequent illnesses and premature death result from smoking should be displayed. Providing the actual risks, we can do away with irrelevant ideas such as unpleasantness, loss of autonomy, and bad parenting, thus allowing consumers to make an informed choice.",factual information,Positive,Positive,Positive

I prefer warning label 2B. I think most cigarette buyers will not be able to decipher what 1A and 1B represent right away; considering that smokers tend to start at a younger age and tend to have a lower level of education Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby. The baby in the incubator gets the point across the best(1B). I think the photo would be much more powerful if the photograph was of a real baby hooked up to the machines. Smoking can kill you. If I had to make a selection out of these images I would pick 2A. However, I personally like the photo of body with the foot tag under cigarettes cause fatal lung disease for smoking can kill you.

Smoking Kills is about as basic as it gets yet none of the new wording actually say just that. A Skull and Crossbones is universally recognized symbol for poison or death and yet none of the graphics depict this. These are the points that I believe will capture someone's attention.

My reasons are as follows:1. Since the 1964 Surgeon Generalâ€™s report Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General highlighted the adverse health effects of tobacco use, the Office of the Surgeon General has been inextricably tied to smoking prevention. The warning labels which have been mandated by law since 1965 have always contained the words â€œSurgeon Generalâ€™s Warning.â€ At the time of Dr. Terryâ€™s report, 42% of adults in the U.S. were smokers â€“ that rate now stands at less than 20%. This drastic reduction in smoking rates rests on public confidence in the recommendations of the Surgeon General.2. The Surgeon General brand has given legitimacy to smoking reduction programs and has stood as a public emblem of the fight against tobacco use. Without the â€œSurgeon Generalâ€™s Warningâ€ prominently displayed on tobacco products and advertisements, that emblem becomes diminished. The context of the warning as an official recommendation from the nationâ€™s most trusted doctor will be lost. 3. Diminishing the Surgeon Generalâ€™s brand would further diminish the stature of the office and would therefore adversely impact other health promotion and disease prevention efforts. The constant presence of the Surgeon General on cigarette warning labels has kept the position in the public consciousness. Efforts in reducing childhood obesity, injury prevention, and reducing underage drinking may be impacted if public awareness of the Surgeon General fades.4. While the Tobacco Control Act does specify the text of the new cigarette warning labels, it does not explicitly prevent FDA from including mention of the Surgeon General on the label.",programs,Positive,Positive,Positive

There were some labels that I thought were more catching than others, and some that I believe wouldn't be effective at all. With the cigarettes being addictive I thought that the first one was more effective (the guy smoking out of this thoat.) I believe that this once is the most effective because it kind of works as a scare tactic. No one want to get to that point where they can't smoke out of their mouth anymore that they have to smoke out of their thoat. With the tobacco smoke can harm your children, I believe the first and second one are most effective because it shows and mother and her child with smoke in the middle of them. The child doesn't know better and is getting the second hand smoke. With the cigarettes cause fatal lung disease is the one where they show a healthy lung and a smokers lung because it is more realistic. With smoking during pregnacy I believe strongly that the one with the pasifer by the ashtray is extremely effective, but the picture is almost making the mother chose between the cigarettes and her baby. With the smoking can kill you I believe that none are them are that effective. They should use the one picture of the tag on a dead body foot. With the tobacco smoke can cause fatal lung diease in non smokers I believe the one that the man is blowing smoke into the womans face is the most effective because the woman might be pregnant too so it could harming more than just her. Finally with the quitting now I believe that the picture of the woman blowing a bubble is the most effective because it shows that her lungs are nice and healthy.

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0367,I believe the idea to add graphics to cigarette cartons will be very beneficial because not every time a smoker buys a pack of cigarettes they think about the harmful things that it is doing to them and other people. I think the best pictures to put on the cartons would be the more graphic ones like the guys with the tracheotomy and comparison of the lungs. I think these would be most beneficial because they visual showing the smoker what they are doing to their body! If I were a smoker it would at least getting me to start thinking about quitting. The other ones that I thought would also turn heads were any of the ones dealing with children because almost everyone in America sympathizes for children. The other one would be the one with the guy with the oxygen mask on his face and the look of pain in his eyes. This one is beneficial because it shows that the cigarettes arenâ€™t physically showing the harmful effects on the body but in reality they are slowly killing them. By the time they start feeling the negative effects it might be too late to quit and they might be in pain and agony all because of a little choice to smoke. Overall I think that the more visual and graphic the pictures are the more people are going to pay attention. Also adding in other factors like the effects of smoking arenâ€™t only killing them but they are also killing the people they love around them. Making these things known and having the smoker being reminded of the effects every time they grab for a cigarette hopefully will be enough to start a little change. But the addiction to cigarettes is so big in the United States that this might only cause a slight impact. But it is a great place to start.,graphic,Positive,Positive,Positive

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0369,"There is enough empirical evidence to support more graphic warning labels, but researchers also know that smokers become habituated and ignore even graphic warnings. Companies also may begin to market stylish cases for cigarette packs that hide the printed covers. Based on my own and othersâ€™ research, warning labels that evoke stronger emotional responses may be more effectiveâ€“although providing quitline numbers in addition to the â€œfear appealâ€ would be most effective. Pictures of real people are likely to be more engaging and evocative and remembered longer than cartoons or pictures of cigarettes or other inanimate objects (i.e., oxygen masks). If not tested already, this would be an easy study to finalize the final images to be used. Images that smokers relate to may be more evocative (i.e., smoker in the rain). Images that elicit defensive reactions will not be effective and may have unintended negative effects. For example, the cartoon image of a mother blowing smoke into her infantâ€™s face while cradled in her arms is likely to be rejected by smokers who perceive that they minimize their babyâ€™s smoke inhalation (smoke by open window, in another room, outside etc) and who then may believe that since they do not blow smoke at their baby that they are a responsible smoker and their baby is not/less at risk. Similarly, the image of bad teeth and a lip sore is compelling but the condition of the teeth may be too poor for most smokers to feel similar to and therefore feel justified in rejecting it as a likely consequence for themselves. Better images or information could be developed for the benefits of quitting: quitline numbers or other resources; immediate benefits related to quality of life-cost, taste, smell, decreased breathing problems and cough, increased energy, etc. I hope there is a plan to continually test these images with smokers, evaluate their effects, and replace old/poorly evaluated images with new ones.",graphic,Positive,Positive,Positive
FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0372,"After reviewing the proposed rule for required warning labels for cigarette packages and advertisements, I was impressed that there is some common sense into those who are wanting this rule to pass. People know that cigarettes are unhealthy and not a lifestyle by choice. If these labels were created a long time ago, I would think that people would start to accumulate some common sense that cigarettes are bad and not a good habit. I do feel that these labels should be applied immediately. Raising the costs of cigarettes obviously has not showed a dramatic change to those who already smoke and I'm sure that these labels will be read, but there will be no dramatic change of how people will make decisions. I am sure that people who do smoke are told by those around them what smoking does, but the step to want to quit does not change overnight with a warning label. What should be done is to start teaching about the effects of smoking to children and teenagers so that the younger generations can grow up to be educated and earn successful careers.

This is definitely a scare tactic, but this image is a better choice than the other options. Tobacco Can Harm Your Child: Again, the first image would most likely be more effective for this issue. The others may be hard for some to understand the exact message and some are just too tacky. I would preferably choose 1.B because it gives a more dramatic effect. Cigarettes Cause Fetal Lung Disease: To be honest, I donâ€™t really approve of any of these images. They are misleading and not vey eye catching. I would suggest making this one simpler, some uneducated people may not exactly know what â€œfatal lung diseaseâ€ really is. Cigarettes Cause Cancer: I would use image 4B with 2Bâ€™s colors. This image will be more effective because it is easy to understand and does get the point across that you can increase your risk of specific cancers. 2Bâ€™s colors are more dramatic with the darkness of them, so I think that will look better for this statement. Cigarettes Cause Stroke and Heart Disease: I would say 3A is the best image for this issue because the others are unnecessary scare tactics. This one has a more educational effect and its point is all in the slogan.Cigarettes During Pregnancy Can Hard Your Baby: I would suggest having a more real life kind of image such as a baby crawling to reach its pacifier and reaches for the ash tray instead. Or having a pregnant mother be smoking a cigarette and showing some sort of transparent image through the momâ€™s belly of the baby being effective. Smoking Can Kill You: I would chose 2B to be the most effective. The others some may find comical for such a critical issue. This image gets the point across without actual photos and has the sort of â€œdeathâ€ colors in it as well. Tobacco Smoke Cause Fetal Lung Disease in Non-Smokers: I would choose 3A because to get this message across it should be well understood if the slogan was not printed on there; so, this one is easy to understand with or without any illustration. Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health: I would chose 1B because this one is easy to read and it sort of illustrates â€œif this tough man can and wanted to quit, so can I.â€ So including an actual photo for this message is by far more effective because it has actually happened; others will hopefully follow.",misleading,Negative,Negative,Negative

For the images of most likely to cause fatal lung disease most of them all have writing that most cigarette user are going to open their pack of cigarettes and not pay attention to the writing.

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0399,"I think it is a great idea to add images to cigarette packages. I think that most people who buy and smoke cigarettes have heard plenty of times about the negative things they are imposing upon their bodies but I do not think they always realize how big of damage they can be making. I think adding graphic images to the packs will make smokers think twice every time they decide to open their pack and have another cigarette. Although I am sure that this will not make every smoker quit, I think it will definitely make an impact in the long run and will make people start questioning their decisions more frequently. I think the more graphic the pictures are, the more impact it will make. The picture still needs to look realistic so that the customer believes it but it also needs to scare them enough into thinking that it could actually happen to them. I think the most effective images would be the ones involving children, the cancer patients, and the tracheotomy. Most people sympathize to children, and genuinely do not wish to harm their own children or baby. Also most people have had someone close to them have cancer or die of cancer so seeing the image of the weak cancer patient could really hit close to home. Finally, I think the pictures of the tracheotomy would really affect smokers because this will show them that they could actually have to be put through this and suffer.",images,Neutral,Neutral,Positive

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0409,"Honestly, I think the proposed pictures will be completely ineffective. The FDA finally has an opportunity to make cigarette smokers think seriously about their deadly habit. However, most of these pictures will simply make smokers laugh, and affect their decision less than the current labels. From a psychologist's standpoint, you need to put pictures on there that show smokers or their loved ones in a way that they would never want them to be. For example, showing a nicely dressed man in a suit lying with his arms crossed does not make people think about how horrible it would be to die from smoking. The worst of all of the pictures are the cartoons. People are not going to consider cartoon people to have the same consequences as they do. I realize you have put a lot of work into this rule and into designing and choosing these pictures. However, I ask that you highly consider drafting new images that graphically show the consequences you mention. To do this, I would suggest using on of the social psychologists on your staff.

Much like elsewhere in the world where this type of additional warning to smokers and their packs has been in the works for years, the message gets across to the viewer clearly. Smoking takes lives, causes pain after years of smoking, effects everyone around that individual and its just out right unhealthy.The images that the FDA has on the main page shows the effects of quitting. The approach is a good start to stop people form smoking in my opinion. Every smoker I know has talked about quitting but seems to not go through with it. Perhaps when they see their cigarette pack, the motivation of a person breathing out, a regular man showing success from quitting, the cigarettes in the toilet, and the message that quitting will help you will be the motivation they need.I have seen other forms of pictures on the internet of warning labels on packs of cigarettes. Gruesome disgusting images repulse me from looking too long. The idea of having a hole in a persons throat on a box you would carry around is disturbing. Why would somebody carry a horrendous image with them in public? Not only is that the weirdest image to see as a bystander to witness a person whipping a pack out of their pocket showing blackened lungs but that person knowingly has seen that image and knows the effects of why those lungs are dark and continues to still smoke! I think after a certain time of buying cigarette packs covered in a gruesome picture a individual will look at the image closely and get the message presented by that warning label.The idea of tobacco still being legal is a mystery to me.

For 'tobacco smoke can harm your children,' the best is the breastfeeding woman. The corpse is the best for 'cigarettes cause fatal lung disease.' The patient in bed is my preference for 'cigarettes cause cancer.' The man with one hand on his chest and the other on his head is my pick for the strokes and heart disease. The baby in the incubator is my pick for harming your baby. I like both the corpse with the zipper stitches and the RIP ad for 'smoking can kill you.' The Black woman crying is the best for the fatal lung disease ad though the graveyard is a close second.

There are many reasons to keep the Surgeon General present in the warning labels, including yesterdayâ€™s release of the Report of the Surgeon General: How Tobacco Causes Disease. This is the 30th tobacco-related Surgeon Generalâ€™s report, an eloquent statement in the compelling scientific compendium of the health effects of tobacco smoke. Since Surgeon General Luther Terryâ€™s historic 1964 report Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General highlighted the adverse health effects of tobacco use, the Office of the Surgeon General has been inextricably tied to smoking prevention. The warning labels which have been mandated by law since 1965 have always contained the words â€œSurgeon Generalâ€™s Warning.â€ At the time of Dr. Terryâ€™s report, 42% of adults in the U.S. were smokers â€“ that rate now stands at less than 20%. This drastic reduction in smoking rates rests on public confidence in the recommendations of the Surgeon General. Without the Surgeon General brand on the warning labels, the warnings promise to be less effective. Since the earliest efforts to reduce the prevalence of smoking, the Surgeon General brand has given legitimacy to smoking reduction programs and has stood as a public emblem of the fight against tobacco use. Without the â€œSurgeon Generalâ€™s Warningâ€ prominently displayed on tobacco products and advertisements, that emblem becomes diminished. Furthermore, the removal of the warning implies the Surgeon General (and perhaps federal public health entities) no longer has concerns regarding tobacco use and health.

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0441,"I like where the FDA is going with this. It seems to be a good concept; however in my opinion not all of the graphics are graphic enough. No pun intended. The first warning states that cigarettes are addictive and has a picture of a guy with smoke coming out of his throat. This graphic will get people thinking. I would go with the black text background. The white background looks like there is more smoke. The other graphics are weak in my opinion. The next two kind of go together. The warnings are tobacco smoke can harm your children and smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby. The graphic for smoke harming children shows a young child. This may be enough to keep someone from smoking for the first time, but someone who is addicted may need a graphic that stirs up a little bit more emotion. The other graphics were a little better with the mother blowing smoke in her babies face being the best one. I think the graphic for smoking during pregnancy showing a baby in the hospital is a little more on point than the graphic with a pacifier ash tray. The baby seems distressed. This may be more real for people. I think the graphic is kind of cartoonish, but how far do you go? It depends on how serious you want people to consider quitting. I would go with the white text on a black background for contract with the rest of the graphic. The next warning is cigarettes cause fatal lung disease. The previous two warnings I discussed use the word â€œcanâ€. This warning is blunt. The graphic showing the feet of a corpse in a morgue is also very matter of fact, but may not be as blunt as the text. Again, I donâ€™t think all the graphics are as graphic as they could be or should be. The other graphic shows what smoke can do to your lungs. I donâ€™t think this graphic is as blunt as it could be. Next is the warning that cigarettes cause cancer. This is an example of a blunt text and graphic. The graphic shows a very sickly looking person in what appears to be a hospital bed. This seems to be the most in your face graphic. It shows suffering. People will think about it. The graphic with the diseased mouth also seems like it would be effective. The next warning is cigarettes cause strokes and heart disease. I like the second graphic with the white text on the black background. The next warning is smoking can kill you. I like the first and third graphic. The third one seems to be more effective for me. Again I like the white text on the black background. Next is the warning that tobacco smoke causes fatal lung disease in nonsmokers. I donâ€™t really like the graphics. There needs to be a graphic that shows many people being affected by the one smoker not just a one to one ratio. A graphic of someone smoking over a grave that says wife or daughter might work. That might shake someone up. The last warning is a tough one. It reads quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health. To me this is a positive message; the only one of its kind. The others state bad things with bad pictures. This one states something good if you quit and has good pictures. I think this one will be confusing and less effective than the others. It may work for some people, but I donâ€™t like the direction. The only good graphic is the guy that has a t-shirt that reads I quit. Who is this guy? Why do people care if he quit? Iâ€™m just saying I think it needs some help. This campaign seems to be a good idea and I think it canâ€™t hurt.",graphic,Positive,Positive,Positive

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0444,"I really like the warning label that says, WARNING: Smoking during pregnancy can harm your baby. I think it is a very good idea to include label such as these to cigarette cartons to let the users know the harm they are causing not only themselves, but the innocent people around them as well. Going into elementary physical education I understand how important it is for parents to reflect on how their actions are affecting the health of their children. If I were a parent that smoked and saw these pictures on my cigarettes I would think twice before lighting up again. I really like the idea of pictures with warnings on the cigarettes I think it is a very good idea and will hopefully have an impact on users. I however think the pictures would be more effective if they were more realistic looking and actual on the gory side. People tend to pay more attention when they see pictures that are a threat to them and tend to be graphic. If the cartons with children on them were more graphic and more realistic looking I think that would make a bigger impact. As non-smoker I think that with this campaign the message about smoking may finally get peopleâ€™s attention. I understand that smoking is a personal chose, but at least with these cartons people might think about all the people besides themselves that they are hurting. My hope is that women who are pregnant will see these pictures on their pack of cigarettes and realize the damages they are causing their unborn child.

The three labels that I believe are the most powerful are Tobacco Smoke Can Harm Your Children 1 & 2, and Cigarettes Cause Cancer 1. These three labels show pictures of real people and appeal to different age groups and demographics. The labels that show cartoons or other images related to smoking and health are not as efficient simply because they are not graphic. I would not expect them to be any more effective than the current labels. The Cigarettes Cause Cancer #1 label would appeal to health conscious teens and young adults like myself. I never want to end up looking like the cancer patient in that picture. In addition, a reason many people quit smoking is because they get pregnant or have children. They quit to reduce risk to their childrenâ€™s health. I do not personally have children and yet these two images still resonate with me because I think about my future childrenâ€™s health.

If the FDA wishes to expand the graphic warning labels to other products, such as smokeless tobacco, our research found that those types of warning labels makes the products seem less appealing and more harmful, to both smokers and nonsmokers.

Therefore, I suggest that the warning should also state several factors as to how tobacco smoke can harm children and what smokers could do to avoid placing themselves in such a situation that could negatively affect children. In addition to this, the possibility of placing an actual true story that involves a child being affected by tobacco smoke would be beneficial. By doing so, smokers will develop a more serious understanding about the situation at hand. From a graphic standpoint, I would suggest taking a picture of a smoker standing a few feet away from little cute toddlers with the mist of tobacco smoke trailing in between both parties. This goes to signify that a few feet is not enough to keep children safe from tobacco smoke. This picture can signify another warning in itself. Overall, I think the colors are a great balance.

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0482,"I believe that it is important to continue to improve warning labels in cigarette packaging. It is beneficial for the warning sign to be visible sending a clear message to those smokers that what they are doing are not only affecting themselves but also the health of other people. I like the idea of including pictures of the mother with the child, but I think it should also incorporate an image of the father smoking. I also liked the image with the oxygen mask because it describes what life could be like if they don't stop smoking, a health inconvenience. However, I do not like the idea of having cartoon images. Young adults can see it attractive instead of them actually being scared to buy a pack. It can elude them to buying because of the packaging.","warning labels, cartoon images",Positive,Neutral,Positive
FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0484,"If you want to seriously deter people from smoking, only the most graphic photos of real people should be used. The cartoons and written warnings are not nearly as scary as real people. The most effective ads would be the girl with a mask, the man dying of cancer, the mouth cancer, the dead man with stapled chest, people blowing smoke at each other and the photos of diseased lungs. Other countries use the more graphic photos and so should the USA.","deter, warnings",Negative,Negative,Negative
FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0485,"Currently the label warning on the cigarette package and commercials are very small in comparison to the graphic design and size of the label. Although the information of cigarettes causes lung cancer and even death is widely noted many young children still seem to have the addiction to cigarettes which is not a good thing at the moment. My mother had an addiction to cigarettes which did not contribute to her death, but did contribute to her son (my younger brother) to be born prematurely and ultimately losing his life due to the harmful effects that was passed down to him. The proposal to make the warnings more visible in advertisements and on the packages of a cigarette boxes is a great idea. The timeline for final regulations is only 6 months away is a reasonable amount of time to sufficiently make the changes determination to the rule, and hopefully help save a life and re-educate the public. The 15 months timeline after the finale rule has been published is a bit long in my opinion. During this timeframe roughly 73,833 people would have died due to the habit of smoking, not to include the second hand smoke that is considered worst than actual smoking itself. My proposal is to keep the six month final determination to give the Tabaco Company an opportunity to identify a change and make necessary steps to comply with the changes. If they do not comply with the change, they should be fined and/or should not be granted the privilege to sell their product on the market. When the six months deliberation is up and the final proposal is laid out, the companies have within 6 months to conform to the change. By decreasing the time will save more lives rather than destroy the lungs of many due to the deadly toxins of Tabaco products. My reasoning is not to reduce the profits of the Tabaco Companies, but to enlighten the consumers who purchase cigarettes the risks associated with smoking.",second hand smoke,Positive,Positive,Positive

First, by definition, randomization enables each unit to have a nonzero (instead of equal) probability of being assigned to a condition (Shadish et al., 2002). It is therefore necessary that investigators take steps to examine the result of randomization (Polit & Beck, 2008) by comparing treatment group with control group at baseline in regard to interested variable, which could not be easily found in this report.In addition, to compare treatment and control group in emotional and cognitive responses to the graphic warning labels, it would be desirable for research designers to ensure no Hawthorn effect is confounding the results.

However, I have some concerns about these requirements and the statements being considered. It is difficult for me to believe that most consumers today do not know the risk of smoking.

Even though these immages capture your attention and may have some effect, I think the most beneficial thing they will accomplish is to increase the cost of producing a pack of cigarettes, and that could actually be good, but may have some unintended negative side effects. Because of the addictive nature of cigarettes smokers will purchase smokes first and often let other essentials go in order to feed their habit. Beyond this, some of the statements I think, could easily be interpreted as being incorrect. For instance, the statements that smoking CAUSES strokes and heart disease may factually be incorrect, or at least partially incorrect. While it may be a contributing factor, if it actually caused these conditions then people who have never smoked should never experience these. The fact that non-smokers do contract heart disease and suffer strokes gives smokers a rational argument that these statements are just propoganda. Better statements would be to say that smoking is one of the leading contributing factors to these conditions, or that smoking increases the likelihood of contracting these conditions; but to simple say that smoking causes them, I think, remains, at least, a partially incorrect statement.",negative side effects,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Messages that merely inform or educate. These messages need to serve as a warning to smokers that they need to quit, and a prevention message to every kid who sees a tobacco advertisement. It can and should serve dual purposes of prevention and cessation.Cigarette packs become litter on our streets and especially in poorer parts of town, they linger. Kids need to see the packs and think revolting thoughts so it serves as a prevention message to them years later. Everytime they go to a 7-11, a gas station, the corner grocery store, they have to check out with their candy and see tobacco products.

FDA-2010-N-0568,FDA-2010-N-0568-0611,"Smoking remains the largest preventable source of mortality in the United States. Although decreasing cigarette use will likely require a range of strategies, one particularly effective way of reaching smokers and potentially decreasing the appeal of cigarettes is through graphic warning labels on cigarette packaging. Considerable psychological research suggests that the mere presentation of hazard information on warning labels, however, is not sufficient to motivate perceptions of risk. Risk appears most readily communicated by information that arouses emotional associations with the activity, and smoking is no exception. Consistent with this reasoning, in a recent study using FDA-proposed labels as well as graphic labels used around the world, we found that warning labels that were perceived as more graphic, more intense, less good, and more fearful were associated with greater health risk perceptions and more smoking aversion. These results suggest that FDA should choose labels based on their ability to arouse negative emotion as these emotions are more likely to lead to greater consumer awareness of the health risks of smoking and to impact changes in smoking behavior. Current FDA-proposed labels did not maximize these reactions relative to other labels used around the world. In addition, preliminary evidence suggested that the existence of more graphic, emotion-arousing warnings may further attenuate the ability of FDA-proposed labels to increase consumer awareness of health risks and decrease smoking behaviors. Based on scientific evidence, FDA should use their authority (and continuing authority) to develop and test graphic warning labels that communicate more negative emotion and thereby increased health risk perceptions and smoking aversion to attain their goals of increasing consumer awareness of the health risks of smoking, impacting changes in smoking behaviors, and providing significant benefits to the American public in human and economic terms.",graphic warning labels,Positive,Positive,Positive

Methodology: 63 students were shown the images provided by the FDA and were asked to rate them based on how effective (Scale: 1 - not effective at all to 7 - extremely effective) were the images in helping smokers intent to quit. Study subjects were informed prior to the study that these images would be placed on cigarette packs and were exposed to each image for approximately five seconds and then were given five seconds to rate its effectiveness. Demographic information along with details about their current and previous smoking habits was also collected. The research questions that guided the study were: i) what kind of images tend to be rated as being highly effective by college students?, ii) what kind of images tend to be rated as being ineffective by college students, and iii) how does effectiveness of images differ by gender, race, smoking status current and past, and proximity to a smoker within immediate family or circle of friends (social influence)? Data was analyzed by conducting a series of ANOVA and MANOVA tests and factor analysis was used to explore the grouping patterns of the images based on effectiveness scores. Results: The most effective images and the least effective images are shown in Table 1 (see attached file). Results from the factor analysis showed that images fell into groups as indicated in Figure 1 (see attached file). This analysis further suggested that the five most effective images as indicated by the post hoc test in ANOVA were all part of the same group identified by factor analysis.

Whch will make them feel that tobacco is not harmful to them. There should be a distinguished line between tobacco and non tobacco products that can be made by youth. By allowing the same trade or brand name by both will only muddy the waters for our youth.,youth,Positive,Positive,Positive
FDA-2011-N-0493,FDA-2011-N-0493-0004,"In regards to docket number FDA-2011-N-0493, I am in agreement. Advertisement agencies should not be allowed to use cartoons, catchy jingles, and sound effects. These methods, along with using sponsorship by athletic, music, or social events could lead children and early adolescents to believe that using tobacco products could somehow make them fit in and be cool among their peers. These advertisement's don't tell children about all the awful and harmful side effects of using tobacco products.Many teenagers believe that just trying tobacco will not lead to any sort of dependency; however, tobacco is very addicting in young teens. Some could have signs of dependency in only a couple of days or weeks. The early effects of tobacco products on a child's brain is another factor to be worried about. Nicotine has immediate effects on the brain. It causes increased stress and alters the brain chemistry. This is very dangerous to a developing brain. Tobacco products effect the whole body in a negative way. These products shouldn't be pressured on children or advertised to them in a way that makes tobacco sound cool or appetizing. Children should be given every opportunity to not pick up this dirty, dangerous habit.","advertisement, children",Negative,Negative,Negative
FDA-2011-N-0493,FDA-2011-N-0493-0005,"The FDA should not amend 21 CFR Part 1140 to allow a tobacco product that shares a trade or brand name with a non-tobacco product to continue to use the name if the tobacco product was sold in the United States before June 22, 2009 , instead of January 1, 1995. Such an amendment to the rule could harm the American people, specifically children and teenagers. The rationale behind the original rule was to prevent brand name association of a tobacco product with a nontobacco product that might appeal to children or teenagers. For example, Eclipse is one of the tobacco products that would be grandfathered in under the revised version of the rule. However, Eclipse shares its name with a popular brand of gum and a wildly popular movie and book that is clearly marketed towards children and teens. The Eclipse movie, part of the Twilight series, grossed $698,491,347 in box office sales (IMDB.com) and is very popular among teens especially. If a child or teen were to see that a tobacco product shared the same as one of their favorite movies, that child might be more likely to try the tobacco product. As stated in the rule notice, over 80% of adult smokers began smoking before the age of 18. Changing the grandfather date to over 14 years later is unnecessary and carries with it too great of a cost. Certain products that should have to change their name will not, putting the health and welfare of Americaâ€™s youth at risk.",children and teens,Negative,Negative,Negative

The FDA should have ultimate authority to regulate tobacco products, marketing for tobacco products, and must definitely ensure tobacco companies are held accountable. As we look closely at the impact of tobacco on our communities and families, it is pretty easy to see how quickly health concerns arise. I think that this legislation will definitely enhance our knowledge and focus as we deal with this constant problem. Some would say that the best defense is education, I would agree to an extent. There must be an active and proactive mission to not only educate teens about smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and other forms of tobacco use, but to engage with the teens on levels they are interested in. Since tobacco is glamorized through many things in this technological age, it is only right to educate more. Where there are five to ten sites on the internet, there must be equal to if not more on every aspect of social media preventing teenagers from picking up the habit. The next thing I appreciate about this piece of legislation is that, it focuses on the health of the family unit.

In fact I would rather see that cigarettes be more closely controlled to keep the out of the hands of minors. The regulation would prohibit tobacco companies from using brand names that are also used on non tobacco products. The intent is to limit the ability of tobacco companies in their attempt to advertise to the youth. The government does not want the companies to be using the brand association that they could leverage to attract youth to using their tobacco products. An example would be a candy company that sold cigarette shaped sugar candies that has the same name as a major cigarette company. Children would be effectively â€œpracticingâ€ smoking if this was allowed, and with name and brand recognition, they children would be more likely to desire to smoke. Along those lines, I personally remember buying the said candy cigarettes and comparing them to the pack of cigarettes my father smoked. The designs on the boxes were almost identical. This regulation would help the battle against American tobacco companies that still use targeted advertising toward children to get them interested in tobacco products. The wide use of a known carcinogen by a nation of people is simply absurd. It is appalling that more is not done to rid the nation of such a disease as the addiction to the chemicals in cigarettes.

FDA-2012-N-0977,FDA-2012-N-0977-0011,"I support the idea to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to protect children and adolescents because it creates numerous issues that these teens are left with for life. The open access and opportunities they have to purchase tobacco products encourages these adolescents to smoke, so limiting their access to it will decrease the number of teens smoking significantly. As kids continue to have access to tobacco substances, they are at risk for an increase in the number and severity of respiratory illnesses, decreased physical fitness, and potential effects on lung growth and function (https://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/tobacco-use-among-children.html). It is also during adolescence that those who take up smoking habits have a more difficult time quitting than those who began smoking as an adult. Many will argue that e-cigarettes are a great relief to teens who choose to smoke, but with the many unknown discoveries and consequences of using these products, it is not any safer. E-cigarettes are too new in the economy to truly understand the effects on the human body, long or short term. They still contain nicotine, which is claimed to be as difficult to give up as heroin. Nicotine is a huge contributor to cancerous growth and can negatively affect your cardiovascular system. Nicotine causes the release of catecholamines into the body which increases the rate of heart beat, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility (https://www.beautyepic.com/nicotine-side-effects/).

FDA-2012-N-0977,FDA-2012-N-0977-0012,"I support the Food and Drug Agencys (FDA) request to regulate and restrict the sale/distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to protect minors. The danger cigarettes and smokeless tobacco brings to minors has gotten out of hand. Children with full lives ahead of them have their hopes and dreams stripped away as a result of another person fueling their addictions. The physical tolls on minors due to smoking has often led to death or shortened life spans. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), minors exposed to smoking are more prone to developing ear infections, respiratory infections/cardiovascular diseases, reduced lung function and growth, and asthma attacks. Statistics show that 5.6 Million children alive today will die early from smoking if measures are not taken. Thats equal to 1/13 alive child in the U.S. today or 2/27 in an average third grade classroom. (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/50th-anniversary/pdfs/fs_smoking_youth_508.pdf) Not only has this dilemma caused harm to minors physical health but it has taken a toll on their mental health. Minors who have submerged to the use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco find themselves attaching onto the habit and creating a harmful, unhealthy addiction.

FDA-2012-N-0977,FDA-2012-N-0977-0013,"In my opinion, the regulations restricting the sale and distribution of cigarettes is a good way to protect children and adolescents. By making it so there are regulations on the selling of drugs, it makes it so minors will be less likely to obtain these items. For example in section 1140.30, it is intended to help protect children and adolescents by reducing the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to them. As a result of this, it can show the adolescents that using drugs is not just a trend nor should it be done. In 2018, about 27.1% of highschoolers used tobacco products, meaning that by this regulation getting passed it could make it possible for those numbers to decrease. Along with that, in section 1140.30, it requires manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to observe certain format and content requirements for labeling and advertising and notify FDA if they intend to use an advertising medium that is not listed in the regulations. When adolescents are able to read what is in the products they are using, it can cause the youth to become more aware and may reconsider it after knowing the consequences. Overall, I feel that this regulation would be successful and it should be passed for the safety of the adolescents.",sale and distribution,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

With their being alternatives to everything why is a healthier alternative to smoking a bad thing. I could make this comment 5 pages long detailing a!l the studies and data showing how much healthier ENDS is than smoking. Big tobacco companies were loosing money because people are quitting smoking more. There are studies shown that prove the more prominent vaping is becoming that smoking is going down. Its more effective than gums its more effective than patches its the healthiest alternative to smoking to date. I have personally been around and been affected by the lives it has changed. My own grandmother used to smoke and she had health problems because of it and now she's much healthier since she switched to an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System. Isn't there not countless studies to show smoking is harmful and unhealthy for people. The 7000 harmful chemicals in a single ciggerette, compared to the single harmful chemical in Ejuice. Nicotine is all ejuice has chemically harmful about it. Tobacco doesn't have a great flavor to it. Where as Ejuice has many different unique flavors that taste good as well. I personally get congested and have trouble breathing around rooms or places where heavy smoking takes place. But vape stores I have no issue just good smells. There was an article about the colors on the bottles and flavors being marketable to kids. While that can be a small concern most responsible adults wouldn't let their child touch their ejuice. The colors are marketing in general I as a consumer would rather buy a bottle of ejuice with a interesting color pattern or design rather than a bland white sticker with a generic flavor. It has no resin to be for kids while it can be associated with child marketing many people who come into a vape store I regularly visit will see a bottle that sticks out visually amd will ask the employee about it. Me as an adult I personally don't have an issue if people wish to smoke or vape. I am grown and should be able to buy tobacco or ejuice if I so please. But you putting so many rules on it and taxing itnso heavily will put this community out of business. Because let me tell you, this didn't work with Prohibition, it didn't work with drugs, it didn't work with anything. The more you tax and ban the more the general public will find ways to illegally make stuff. And personally I'd feel safer buying my ejuice from professional vendor than buy it from a random guy I know. Because I will of vaping gets banned I will not stop vaping I will just be more unsafe and unaware of what I will be purchasing. Putting it as a direct correlation, marijuana. Marijuana was illegal everywhere. But now some states have legalized it medically and recreationally. And Colorado as a prime example taxes are reasonable for the product, their tax revenue has sky rocketed, and there is less crime. ENDS can help too in many of the same ways. It provides more business because as a consumer vaping has one of the highest sale rates there are so many products already and people are waiting for the next one next flavor of ejuice better quality interesting devices. Taxing it. Not greatly not. To where its becomes unbearable like the tea tax by the British in this country's early history. Average taxing that is fair to the buainess.

Why not tax the industry humanly and instead of trying to shut down the tobacco industry let them both exist time will tell the health benefits of both. And why not also regulate tobacco tonwhere instead of 7000 harmful chemicals there are only a handful.

It is important to understand that cigarette smoking accounts for 65-85% of our global tobacco consumption; it is attributed to respiratory disorders such as COPD and emphysema; cardiovascular hazards such as increased vascular spasms and atherosclerosis leading to acute and chronic myocardial events and cancer. It is also important to understand the lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in most high-income countries (Acuff et al., 2016). I think that the laws surrounding the manufacturing of tobacco is a great start in helping to decrease the effects that it has on the health of our country.

I repeat, the tobacco industry was willing to live with and the members of Congress who were and are still beholden to the tobacco cartel would agree to.The tobacco industry has had their four years of bought time to expand their marketing to e-cigarettes so it is now time to eliminate mentholated cigarettes from the market.

Safety aside, the FDA has no choice but to apply the same criteria in judging menthol. The central question is whether menthol plays a role in marketing cigarettes to consumers. As the 1999 founder and director of WhyQuit.com, the leading abrupt nicotine cessation (cold turkey) education, motivation and support site, the method that each year generates more long-term successful U.S. ex-smokes than all other methods combined, I strongly support elimination of the use of menthol in cigarettes.The FDA need only look at store menthol cigarette marketing at more than 140,000 neighborhood convenience stores. There, the industry spends billions annually on cool, refreshing, flavor and pleasure menthol marketing. There is strong evidence that menthol acts as an anesthetic agent that makes cigarette smoking more appealing by masking the harshness of burning tobacco. The addition of menthol deceives consumers into thinking that cigarettes are less harsh and therefore safer. Furthermore, for more than half a century, menthol cigarette brands have been disproportionately targeted to African Americans.Congress banned the easy flavorings while handing the FDA the one opposed by powerful economic interests. Banning menthol would not only diminish youth smoking dependency onset by removing menthol's analgesic effects, it will likely aid in accelerating both nicotine cessation and transfer to cleaner forms of delivery, such as smokeless, e-cigarettes and replacement nicotine. While I hope that the FDA is at last determined and serious about putting a dent in our nation's leading cause of preventable death, please understand that, in regard to smoking cessation, my confidence in the FDA was shattered long ago. Thirty-one years ago, the FDA approved nicotine gum based upon two studies, despite obvious and glaring study blinding concerns discussed and reviewed by the advisory panel. Since then, the FDA has continued to allow use of placebo controls despite clear and compelling evidence that 3 to 4 times as many assigned to placebo correctly declare their assignment as guess wrong, and can do so within 24-48 hours of cessation (peak withdrawal). While approved products consistently show greater efficacy over placebo, they have proven ineffective and consistently fail to prevail over cold turkey and unassisted quitters in population level reviews. Whether considering light or heavy smokers, the evidence is clear, real-world toying with replacement nicotine undercuts cessation. We've watched as FDA approved quitting products have undercut and stalled cessation, while likely costing hundreds of thousands of lives. As you can see, it's my opinion that the FDA and botched quitting product approval is the primary reason for America's failed smoking cessation policy. The evidence is also clear that menthol is being used to market cigarettes and mask smoke's toxins.

I am submitting these comments on behalf of our company and its [30] employees regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.As tobacco wholesalers, it is clear to us that unreasonable regulation, including a ban on menthol in cigarettes, would have significant unintended results. Illicit tobacco markets are pervasive today. Illicit markets will only become worse if the FDA imposes overly restrictive regulations on menthol in cigarettes or bans them.The contraband market would thrive under unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettesand would increase criminal activity, including activities by organized crime and terrorist groups. Federal and state law enforcement efforts already are under tremendous pressure. They will not be able to handle the resulting increase in criminal activities.Wholesalers are licensed by the states where we operate and are subject to many laws and regulations. If menthol cigarettes are treated differently than non-menthol cigarettes, legal sales will be driven underground and outside of government supervision. In addition, some entrepreneurs will likely smuggle cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions, self-mentholate them, and resell them â€“ thereby further increasing criminal activities and adding even more enforcement burdens to law enforcement.In addition, restrictive regulation of menthol cigarettes would have severe adverse effects on those employed in our industry. Many thousands of working Americans â€“ including those in our industry â€“ rely on menthol sales for their jobs beyond the factory workers who manufacture them. Overall, nearly 500,000 U.S. jobs depend in whole or in part on the sale of menthol through existing legal channels.We speak from experience. Wholesalers already face underground market competition in many product areas. Adding menthol cigarettes to this inventory of items will drive even more sales underground â€“ putting more companies out of business and more people out of work. So, the consequences would be lost jobs and lost tax revenues to federal, state and local governments, many of whom are already cutting services because of revenue shortfalls.Unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettes is a bad idea. Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs and taxes for illegal jobs and a thriving contraband market that will have negative effects on public health.Sincerely,Eugene NaydovichJN Distributor","menthol, bans",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0040,"I feel that there should be no level of menthol in cigarettes. The menthol is in cigarettes to attract consumers, as it is a taste and flavor that customers enjoy. It has been proven in numerous studies that cigarettes can cause serious health problems, so by allowing menthol to remain in cigarettes, we are essentially promoting its use, and thus leading to more adverse events, putting an even larger burden on our already out of control health care costs for the nation. There shouldnâ€™t be any flavor of any kind in any tobacco product. Again, why as a country are we endorsing products that have been proven to cause death and other serious medical conditions? FDAâ€™s mission statement is to protect public health, and how can you sell someone tobacoo products and claim that your still protecting their health? Itâ€™s impossible. The FDA also regulates the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to reduce tobacco use by minors. Flavors are attracting to minors, and should not be allowed in tobacco products, as it just makes the idea more enticing to them.I am a pharmacist, and I think it is absolutely preposterous that tobacco products are even still on the market, let alone products with menthol for flavor. Why arenâ€™t tobacco products regulated like drugs are? If a drug had the long list of proven side effects like all tobacco products do, it would be pulled from the market, and the pharmaceutical company would undoubtedly face litigation. I refuse to sell cigarettes to patients in the pharmacy. As a pharmacist, it is my duty to promote the health and wellbeing of my customers, very similar to the role of the FDA. How can I sell something to my customers when I know that itâ€™s unsafe? Health care costs in this country continue to rise, and adverse events from tobacco products are a huge chunk of those costs. These health care costs are preventable, but theyâ€™re not being prevented in part because the government isnâ€™t doing everything in their power to help. Menthol and other flavoring should not be allowed in cigarettes. Itâ€™s bad enough that tobacco products are sold to begin with. If we as a country really care about protecting public health, we need to step up and make appropriate decisions. Banning menthol and other flavors can be a huge first step in that process, and lead to a healthier country, with less preventable health care costs.

Some Native American tribes believe in sacred tobacco as a medicine. This is very different from commercial tobacco use. When not abused, sacred tobacco can help with ceremonies, obtaining native names, and obtaining information from elders. In contrast, commercial tobacco appropriates Native American imagery to deceptively market â€œnaturalâ€ menthol cigarettes. Menthol tobacco is one issue in the larger struggle with commercial tobacco abuse and its effect on Native Americans and those on tribal land in Wisconsin.

The FDA is studying whether to ban menthol cigarettes from the marketplace. Therefore, criminalizing the sale and distribution of a currently legal product.

It causes over 400,000 deaths in the U.S. each year, and approximately 8,600,000 Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking. As of 2011, 19% of U.S. adults â€“ 43.8 million people â€“ smoke cigarettes. WHEREAS, smoking costs the U.S. $193 billion annually, including $97 billion per year in lost productivity and $96 billion per year in healthcare costs. WHEREAS, each day 3,800 adolescents try smoking for the first time, 1,000 of whom will become addicted. WHEREAS, menthol cigarettes are particularly attractive to kids. According to national surveys, 47.7% of adolescent smokers (age 12-17) report menthol cigarette use compared to 40.8% of young adult smokers (age 18-25) and 31.5% of adult smokers (age 26 and older). WHEREAS, among children, the youngest smokers are the most likely to smoke menthols, with a greater proportion of middle school age smokers reporting menthol use than high school age smokers. WHEREAS, menthol cigarettes are used disproportionately in communities of color: 82.6% of African American smokers, 53.2% of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander smokers, 32.3% of Hispanic or Latino smokers, and 31.2% of Asian American smokers use menthol cigarettes as opposed to 23.8% of White smokers. WHEREAS, one model of smoking in the U.S. concludes that if menthol was prohibited, between 2010 and 2020 over 2.2 million people would not start smoking. By 2050, the number of people who would not start smoking would reach 9 million. WHEREAS, a leading model of smoking in the U.S. predicts that a 10% quit rate among menthol smokers would save thousands of lives, preventing 4,000 smoking-attributable deaths in the first ten years, and that 300,000 lives would be saved over forty years. THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the City-County Health District Board requests that the FDA add menthol to the list of characterizing flavors that are prohibited as constituents or additives of cigarettes. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that City-County Health District shall send this resolution to the following FDA officials:.............................................................. NEWSNEWSNEWSNEWSFor Immediate Release - August 30, 2013City-County Health Board urges FDA to prohibit menthol cigarettesMenthol flavoring in cigarettes should be prohibited because it helps entice young people to start smoking, and it makes it harder for those who smoke mentholated cigarettes to quit, according to City-County Health District (CCHD) Board Chair Sharon Buhr.At their August 27 meeting in Valley City, the local health board unanimously approved a resolution calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to â€œadd menthol to the list of characterizing flavors that are prohibited as constituents or additives of cigarettes.â€In 2009, Congress prohibited fruity and candy-like flavoring in cigarettes, but exempted menthol, even though its minty taste gives it tremendous youth appeal and makes it the most popular of all flavors, said Vicki Voldal Rosenau, CCHDâ€™s tobacco prevention coordinator. â€œTobacco companies routinely add flavors to mask the harsh taste of tobacco, making it easier for young people to start smoking,â€ she added.In declining to prohibit menthol, Congress passed the buck to the FDA, directing that agency to decide whether or not continued sale of menthol cigarettes is â€œappropriate for public health,â€ according to Rosenau. More than 20 months ago, an advisory committee of leading scientific experts concluded a study and reported to the FDA that: â€œRemoval of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.â€ â€œThere is essentially scientific consensus that the use of menthol in cigarettes promotes tobacco initiation and deters cessation,â€ Buhr added.Because the FDA still has not acted on this recommendation, health experts from across the country are now urging the agency to do so, Rosenau said. In petitioning the FDA, the local health board joins at least 20 leading national organizations and dozens of concerned physicians and other individuals who have already called on the agency to prohibit mentholated cigarettes.# # #For more information, contact:Vicki Voldal RosenauCity-County Health District Tobacco Prevention CoordinatorCity-County Health District230 â€“ 4TH St. NW, Room 102Valley City, ND 58072490-1325vvrosenau@ictc.com","children, school age",Negative,Negative,Negative
FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0067,"Re: Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521To Whom It May Concern:On July 23, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sought public comment and information related to menthol in cigarettes. I am submitting these comments on behalf of the Vermont Grocersâ€™ Association and our member retailers regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.VGA represents over 600 stores in Vermont, from small country and convenience stores to supermarkets.As retailers, we believe strongly that overly restrictive regulations, including a ban on menthol in cigarettes, would have significant unintended results. Current contraband activity in tobacco is well documented, and counterfeit cigarettes are smuggled into the country today. With a ban, contraband menthol cigarettes would inevitably be sold through an expansion of the current underground market. Outlawing menthol in cigarettes would unquestionably have negative effects.Illicit markets would have a significantly negative effect on public health. Youth smoking is one area that demands particular attention. Given a contraband market, it is counterintuitive to believe that a menthol ban will reduce underage smoking, the announced objective of Tobacco Control Act. In fact, illicit tobacco markets undermine public health efforts to prevent underage smoking.Much of the responsibility to curb tobacco sales to underage youths falls on retailers. Retailers are on the front lines of preventing sales to underage youths by supporting and implementing efforts to prevent underage smoking. Our member retailers perform the standard age check and they undergo periodic reviews to ensure compliance with age-of-purchase laws. They take these responsibilities seriously.Illicit markets, however, undermine efforts to prevent underage smoking. If menthol is banned or severely restricted, retailers will be competing with a greatly expanded underground market for cigarettes. Cigarette sales wonâ€™t occur in our stores. Sales will take place down the street, outside our stores, and you can bet that these street-corner vendors wonâ€™t check IDs for birthdates. If that occurs, it will hinder the progress we have made toward reducing access to cigarettes for minors. Studies back up this conclusion. In 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Canadian Convenience Stores Association surveyed hundreds of sites to study the proliferation of contraband tobacco at high schools in Ontario and Quebec. It found that nearly one-third of the cigarettes found at Ontario high schools and more than 40 percent of those found at Quebec high schools were contraband products.An ban would also be undercut because entrepreneurs will smuggle cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions and self-mentholate them to add to their profits. In addition, illicit markets result in a negative effect on public health because of the sales of more low-cost counterfeit cigarettes. Many illicit cigarettes contain unknown contents or quality and are not made in compliance with FDA requirements. State and federal studies, in fact, have shown that counterfeit cigarettes contain far more dangerous ingredients. The ATF warned of this when it said in a fact sheet, â€œconsumers do not know what ingredients are used to manufacture these cigarettes. Counterfeit cigarettes pose a significant health risk to consumers for this reason.â€Unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettes is a bad idea. Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs and taxes for illegal jobs and a thriving contraband market that will have negative effects on public health.Sincerely,Jim HarrisonVermont Grocersâ€™ Association",overly restrictive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Currently, one out of every three smokers chooses menthols. It is likely that a substantial portion of these smokers will turn to the black market if menthol cigarettes are banned. As many studies have shown, black market cigarettes contain unknown and unregulated ingredients that can be dangerous for users. It is better that the production of menthol cigarettes stays with licensed and regulated manufactures.Over-regulating or banning menthol cigarettes is not sound public policy. It will not help accomplish the FDAâ€™s goals of safeguarding consumers or preventing children from accessing cigarettes. Instead, it will fuel black market sales while costing thousands of Americans their jobs. It is inappropriate government interference that will have far-reaching unintended consequences.It is important to recognize what these new regulations could potentially do for federal, state, and local law enforcement. Invariably, restrictive bylaws like the ones described in this particular FDA case lead to new instances of smuggled cigarettes, making it substantially more difficult for border agents and police officers on seemingly every level and jurisdiction to do the jobs they already have on their respective plates.For the reasons stated above, please keep menthol cigarettes legal.",over regulations,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

States and localities are always competing for good manufacturing jobs. I am fortunate to have one of those jobs in the tobacco industry. But if menthol cigarettes, that make up one third of the products sold is banned, not only will I be at risk of losing my job so will many others in my community. Sometimes it seems that regulators donâ€™t make the connection between what they do and what happens as a result. Let me make it perfectly clear that should FDA ban menthol cigarettes, many jobs will be lost. The federal government has the responsibility to protect public health and make sure that consumers have all the information they need to make good decisions for their health and safety. There are many ways to accomplish this important responsibility short of banning an entire industry. For cigarettes, strict age restrictions and health warning labels have been very effective at reducing teen smoking and informing consumers about the risks of smoking. However, putting the entire menthol cigarette industry out of business is stepping way over the line and is an example of extreme government overreach. Reject more regulations on menthols because it is the right thing to do. Cordially, Stephanie R Greene",reject,Positive,Positive,Positive

I am very concerned about any health threats that have a major impact on the citizens I serve.Data shows that the LGBT community smokes significantly more than the general population. For example, recent data in California shows that LGBT individuals smoke twice as much as all others in our state. There is also evidence that our community smokes menthol at a high rate as well. A 2010 report from the National Youth Advocacy Coalition (NYAC) found that 71% of the LGBT young adults between 18 and 24 years of age surveyed smoked menthol. This is consistent with the results of the FDAâ€™s recent report that indicates a higher rate of menthol smoking among other minorities that face discrimination. As the FDAâ€™s own research also concluded, menthol increases the likelihood that youth and young adults will start smoking, become more heavily addicted to nicotine, and have a more difficult time quitting.Banning the use of menthol flavoring in tobacco products would help everyone, but it would have the largest impact on segments of the population, such as the LGBT community, that already smokes more and uses menthol products at a higher rate than others.I support a ban on the use of menthol in tobacco products be adopted.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,Scott WienerSan Francisco Supervisor, District 8","LGBT, health threats",Negative,Negative,Negative

Both segments of the market are flavored. It makes no sense that the FDA is considering regulating Menthol cigarettes differently than Classis Tobacco Flavor Cigarettes. There is no scientific evidence or behavioral evidence to support that either if better or worse or attracts older or younger segments of the population. The FDA is required to rely on scientific evidence and also consider the unintended consequences of any action taken.Did Prohibition not teach us anything?We are already suffering through black market enterprises in the U.S. tobacco distribtion channel that did not exist when tax rates were reasonable.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0091,"I am writing on behalf of the North Carolina Fraternal Order of Police (NCFOP). NCFOP is the largest law enforcement organization in the State of North Carolina. We are comprised of over 6100 law enforcement officers in our state. Our members work as local, state and federal officers who protect each of us day and night. NCFOP has a long, proud tradition in advocating about public policy issues which impact community safety and our members. As an organization, NCFOP has no position on the medical or scientific issues regarding the affect of the use of menthol cigarettes. However, we believe any governmental decision, especially a ban on a previously legal product, should not only be based on science, but on the secondary and overall repercussions. We are most troubled what a prohibition on menthol cigarettes would have regarding public safety in communities across the state.The demand for menthol cigarettes will not simply disappear by prohibition. If menthol cigarettes were banned, then it would simply provide another product for individuals and organized crime to make considerable profit utilizing their established networks. In doing so, organized crime can continue to expand. The more criminal activity created, the greater the burden on law enforcement.Anyone working in law enforcement understands: cigarette smuggling already exists. Over the past decade, federal, state, and special joint operations of law enforcement have uncovered several large tobacco diversion operations in North Carolina, including one of the largest in the Unites States operated by a Hezbollah organized crime group. Federal ATF agents have acknowledged money from these operations often go to organized crime or terrorist organizations. Plain and simple: the black market for cigarettes is highly lucrative. Banning menthol cigarettes would have a broad trickle down impact on taxes, enforcement and criminal activity. First, federal, state and local governments lose significant tax revenue, which support law enforcement agencies. In North Carolina, the loss of cigarette sales tax revenue, by banning menthol cigarettes, would accumulate in the tens of millions of dollars. Second, the scope of tobacco smuggling would increase because menthol cigarettes would become an illicit product in demand for consumers. Therefore, law enforcement agencies would have an increased burden to monitor and enforce all types of tobacco activities. Finally, the increase in the black market would allow criminal enterprises to spawn and proliferate.At a time when the federal government is going through sequestration, state and local governments are to cutting back, law enforcement does not need another negative element detrimentally impacting public safety. It is a matter of concern to all in law enforcement if the federal government on one had requires additional enforcement resources by creating a black market, while with the other hand it takes revenues away from the governments. It is counter productive. As experienced law professionals, the members of NCFOP believe a black market of contraband, illicit and unregulated cigarettes will be large if the FDA bans menthol cigarettes. There is no doubt, illegal menthol cigarettes will find their way to consumers. A significant contraband market will deny governments of revenue, increase the availability of illicit cigarettes to underage youths, and fuel organized criminal organizations.Therefore, we would the FDA extensively examine the collateral consequences on black markets and tobacco smuggling in contemplating a ban on menthol cigarettes.

FDA published on July 23, 2013, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to obtain information related to the potential regulation of menthol in cigarettes. Maryland Retailers Association represents retailers throughout Maryland with over 1200 locations. MRA is a non-profit trade association and was founded in 1958. MRA is the voice of retailing in Maryland with members in all the various categories in retailing from grocery stores to department stores to antique stores. Of the questions raised by FDA in the ANPRM, MRA will focus on addressing question C3:â€œIf menthol cigarettes could no longer be legally sold, is there evidence that illicit trade in menthol cigarettes would become a significant problem? If so, what would the impact of any such illicit trade on public health? How would such illicit trade compare to the existing illicit trade in cigarettes?â€One of the major crime issues with which retailers must deal is the illicit markets of a variety of products. From stolen merchandise to counterfeits to every imaginable form, the illicit market for products is very substantial and an ever challenging concern for law enforcement and honest retailers. To create an even more robust and lucrative illicit market through regulation will have unintended consequences for both public health and law enforcement. There is substantial evidence of global capabilities to produce, distribute and sell products. There is no evidence, except speculation and hypothesis, that menthol cigarettes would be any different. With 30% of the domestic cigarette market in menthol cigarettes, the demand can easily be quantified. Thus, production, distribution and sales of contraband cigarettes would have a lucrative void that could easily be filled. Global manufacturing and distribution would ramp up to meet this demand. As a result, law enforcement would be further tasked with the â€œcat and mouse gameâ€ of trying to seal the borders in the United States. As with other banned substances, the public health threat of increased violence would be substantial.States and the federal government would lose substantial revenue by eliminating 30% of the cigarette market. This revenue would not be available for the increased enforcement efforts required to have an effective ban on menthol cigarettes. In addition, the public health efforts by states to reduce teen smoking through programs funded from taxes on cigarettes would also be reduced. Such programs have been heralded for the last two decades as one of the most pressing public health issues. As honest, licensed retailers grapple with the decline in sales, particularly in convenience stores, an underground distribution and sales system will develop. This would be outside the regulatory scheme of licensing and enforcement of underage sales laws. This regulatory framework has helped reduce underage smoking, which would not apply to an illicit market. Without sales through licensed and regulated retailers, progress to reduce underage access to cigarettes will be reversed. In addition, the illicit market that will be created will be tax free and likely cheaper than other cigarettes, which will reverse the efforts to curb underage smoking through higher prices. There is ample evidence throughout the United States of cigarette smuggling from low tax states into higher taxes states. However, an illicit market in menthol cigarettes would be tax free and outside this regulatory system. The impact on retailers would be felt almost immediately through lost sales. The result would be a reduction in employees to decrease costs because of the lost sales. This would be particularly acute for convenience stores, which are smaller retail outlets with a higher percentage of sales coming from tobacco products. The loss of 30% of cigarettes sales cannot be easily replaced in these types of stores. Given that FDA in its most recent scientific assessment concluded there is not increased disease risk from menthol cigarettes than non-menthol cigarettes, MRA urges FDA not to proceed to rulemaking to ban menthol cigarettes. The public health risk of an illicit cigarette market, the economic impact on retailers, especially convenience stores, and the potential for setting back efforts to discourage underage access and smoking are too great to proceed further.Sincerely,Patrick DonohoPresident",distribution,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0204,"Tobacco is an important agricultural, manufacturing and retail product for our economy. The FDA should consider a number of non-traditional factors in making their decision.The tobacco industry has wide-ranging impacts, affecting not only farms and manufacturers, but also wholesale and retail stores. Beyond the farm gate, value is added to tobacco leaf by combining it with other inputs and using labor and capital to process, store, market, advertise and transport it. Businesses include a mark-up to make a profit and to cover excise taxes collected from manufacturers and wholesalers. Generally, the manufacturers pay federal excise taxes; the wholesalers pay state excise taxes and consumers pay sales taxes on a percentage of retail sales value. Last fiscal year, menthol cigarettes accounted for over $900 million in pre-tax sales revenues in our state. The loss in tax revenue from a ban on menthol cigarettes alone would have a vast impact on our state budget. North Carolina received over $250 million in tax revenue from the sales tax imposed on cigarettes last fiscal year. Menthol cigarettes attributed almost one-third of the cigarettes sales tax revenue.Clearly, there is incentive for the contraband market to add this product to their broad distribution network. In doing so placing an added burden to law enforcement agencies as institutions and agents as individuals. Furthermore, a significant contraband market will deny governments of revenue; increase availability of illicit cigarettes to underage youths, and fuel organized crime groups. It is especially important to consider these factors when dealing with a banning a previously legal product.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0205,"Since the introduction of tobacco by colonial settlers in the late 1600â€™s, tobacco has been an integral part of North Carolinaâ€™s culture and economy. It has helped our state and nation grow. North Carolina is the center of the United States tobacco industry and production. However, tobacco has not been without controversy. As the FDA examines regulating menthol cigarettes, the decision should be formulated with all the various consequences and factors. There are many financial and social issues to consider. Tobacco has a large financial impact on tax revenues in North Carolina. In the most recent state revenue collections released in the middle of April, cigarette tax revenues amounted to $190 million for the first nine months. While the revenue collections are down 6% from a comparable period in 2011, it is still very significant. Menthol cigarettes are accountable for approximately one-third of cigarette sales. Thus, if the FDA were to ban menthol cigarettes from the market, we would see a significant drop in future state revenue collections up to $60 million or more.On top of the vast tax revenue decrease, law enforcement agencies would have to deal with growth in the illegal trade of menthol cigarettes. The demand will not disappear. Consumers will seek out avenues to obtain them. The high potential and low risk of contraband tobacco trade are especially appealing to criminal organizations with already established smuggling operations for other substances which can easily use existing contacts and resources to establish menthol cigarette opportunities.",menthol,Positive,Positive,Positive

Mentholated cigarette use is most common amongst youth smokers, composing 56.5% of adolescent smokers or 1.2 million smokers, with the second most common group being young adults composing 5.2 million smokers. In 2004, 14% of young adult smokers used mentholated cigarettes, but by 2010 the rate had increased to 16.3% of young adults smoking mentholated cigarettes (Giovino et al.). Non-mentholated cigarette use decreased from 2004 to 2010 from 25.7% to 16.3% respectively. In the 2004 â€“ 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows that the youngest participants, aged 12-17 years old, had the highest past month menthol use (Lee et. al.), with 47.7% of youth smoking mentholated cigarettes compared to 31.5% of those aged over 25 years (Yerger).Menthol has been shown to have antiallergenic, antibacterial, cough suppressing, analgesic, and soothing effects to the upper respiratory tract. This leads to a more pleasurable experience for first time smokers, suggesting that menthol reinforces smoking and leads to increased dependence. Research has shown decreased negative perceptions of harshness and irritation from smoking, replacing those effects with feelings of coolness and smoothness. The smoke released from mentholated cigarettes is also perceived by the smoker as being less harsh due to the reduced offensive odor, thus making smoking appear more socially acceptable (Lee et. al.). Some smokers are under the impression that smoking mentholated cigarettes is less dangerous because of mentholâ€™s association with cough drops (Klausner et al).Prior to 1956, approximately 3% of cigarettes contained menthol, whereas now it is estimated to be added to over 90% of cigarettes. Due to recent litigation, millions of pages of previously private tobacco company documents are now available showing tobacco companyâ€™s awareness of mentholâ€™s ability to increase ease of initiation and its addictive properties especially amongst the youth (Lee et. al.). Marketing images from menthol brands produced by companies such as Newport, Camel, and Marlboro targeted youth populations and represent their product as a pleasurable and refreshing experience. The images show attractive young adults enjoying themselves on their advertisements (Klausner et al). Other company images suggest their menthol cigarettes as reduced risk with images of â€œfreshnessâ€ (Benowitz et al.). These marketing strategies targeting specific populations demonstrate that the industry has long understood mentholâ€™s role in increasing initiation and dependency.A ban on menthol would have a significant impact on public health (Winikoff et al). Smoking initiation among youth would be reduced, as would the progression towards dependency. This would reduce the burden of tobacco related chronic disease to both smokers as well as those exposed to second hand smoke.Sincerely,Andrew Blix, RN, BSNDaiquiri Frieling, RN, BSNDawn Lyke, RN, BSNSarah Whipple, RN, BSNReferencesBenowitz, N., & Samet, J.

Licensed retailers are the class of trade that is most effective at preventing the sale of age restricted products to minors. By banning menthol from cigarettes (which from your own research is proven not to be a health issue) you will be worsening the problems of the existing black market for cigarettes. Cigarette sellers on the black market do not care to whom they sell cigarettes and they are a significant supplier of tobacco to minors in our area. Competing with illegal sellers already puts our company at a disadvantage. Please do not strengthen their business model for them. Strong, licensed retailers who operate within the law are the best defense we have in keeping tobacco from minors. Please do not undermine our effort.

We employ 27 to 29 employees in our three stores and office staff.We work hard to ensure we don't sell to a minor, this is a tough task at times. We train and instuct everyone that we are tofollow the rules governing our business and the moral ground of doing the right thing. The last thing we want is to sell to a minor, we as I stated with our years of serving the public are in business for the long term.We think as a company that outlawing menthol cigarettes would be counter productive, people want what they cannot have, like the time beer and spirits were outlawed. The outcome had undesired results the pipe line was then controled by the criminal element. ( Mafia )Congress specially allowed the use of menthol cigarettes in the Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.The federal law covers all cigarettes to ban or restrict one that is cover by these laws would fly in the face of the mandate given to the FDA by congress.You have us retailers as your front line to protect the young public from purchasing cigarettes. A menthol ban or restriction placed the black market will fester and grow. The access to the young public will increase and more accessible without the retailers being the filter.I have never smoked, that is a personal decision, government something tries to tell us how to live our lives.The smokers have been told you have to pay for your own health care treatment relative to smoking, the Master Settlement Agreement was agreed to by 45+ states in 1998.Smokers had a Federal increase in cigarette taxes for the health care cost of young childern and teens in 2008.This was a increase of 30% or more to the overall program and increase the age of the childern that could qualify for the program. Most every state is funding all sorts of public projects off the tens of millions of dollars collected each year . Non smokers benefit from these public funds that go into the general fund or specfic projects in individual states.My point is education should be the tool used, it is now taught in schools at early ages, let the adult individual make the decision regarding choice.

P&CMA is engaged and vigilant of any regulatory efforts that substantially impact our retail sales, much less eliminate market items and reduce our customersâ€™ choices.The FDAâ€™s current review of menthol cigarettes raises great concerns for the P&CMA membership. We are particularly concerned this review could result in the elimination of menthol cigarettes. Whatever the purported motives and objectives for a ban on menthol, we know from experience that menthol cigarettes would flourish in the black market in Alabama and across the country. As a result, an outright ban on menthol cigarettes would negatively impact our convenience store operators, while greatly benefitting counterfeiters and organized crime.In addition, the prohibition of menthol cigarettes would have a huge impact on Alabamaâ€™s state budgets. The most recent sales data reveal that menthol cigarettes account for more than one-third of tobacco sales in Alabama. As mentioned previously, the idea that menthol cigarette purchasers would simply buy non-menthol cigarettes ignores past experience of the black market. So not only would our membersâ€™ sales be greatly reduced from a ban on menthol, but it would cut an estimated $100 million per year from our stateâ€™s General Fund and several of the childrenâ€™s service that those funds support. Consequently, the Petroleum & Convenience Marketers of Alabama respectfully request careful deliberation in your review of menthol cigarettes. In doing so, P&CMA urges you to weigh all relevant factors including the negative financial impact to our members, the increase in criminal black market sales, and the reduction in state tax revenue that benefits childrenâ€™s services.

I am submitting these comments on behalf of our company and its employees regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.Smoker Friendly is a coalition of family-owned, small businesses operating tobacco retail establishments committed to responsibly retailing tobacco products. Combined, Smoker Friendlyâ€™s members operate over 800 retail facilities which employ over 3,000 employees and service over 1,000,000 customers, with annual sales of approximately $750,000,000. We also own a private label cigarette brand sold by our members, including a menthol category.As tobacco retailers and distributors, it is clear to us that unreasonable regulations, including a ban on menthol in cigarettes, would have significant unintended results. Illicit tobacco markets are pervasive today. Illicit markets will only become worse if the FDA imposes overly restrictive regulations on menthol in cigarettes.Contraband markets have a negative effect on public health because they undermine efforts to prevent underage smoking. There is no way to monitor whether illicit cigarettes are sold to underage youth. Illicit markets also result in a negative effect on public health because of the ingredients in counterfeit cigarettes. Many health departments and government agencies have identified that counterfeit cigarettes have significantly more contaminants that pose far greater risks than those made by manufacturers in compliance with FDA requirements. The contraband market that would be exacerbated by a ban would also increase criminal activity, including activities by organized crime and terrorist groups. Federal and state law enforcement efforts already are constrained. They will not be able to handle the resulting increase in criminal cases.If menthol cigarettes are banned, otherwise legal sales will be driven underground and outside of government supervision. In addition some entrepreneurs will likely smuggle cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions, self-mentholate them, and resell them-thereby further increasing criminal activities and adding even more enforcement burdens to law enforcement. In addition, a ban on menthol cigarettes would have severe adverse effects on those employed in our industry. Many thousands of working Americans - including those in our industry-rely on menthol sales for their jobs beyond the factory workers who manufacture them. Overall, nearly 500,000 U.S. jobs depend in whole or in part on the sale of menthol through existing legal channels, according to a study by Altria.The Virginia Crime Commission found that â€œtrafficking hurts all legitimate manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers,â€ because we are faced with unfair competition in the form of lower prices offered by competitors- i.e., illicit tobacco marketers. This is correct. A ban on menthol cigarettes would hit retailers including our company and our employees hard.Consumers would feel the impact of lost revenue and profits. As one indirect consequence, retailers could be forced to raise prices for non-tobacco products to make up for lost cigarette sales.We speak from experience. Retailers already face underground market competition in many product areas. Adding menthol cigarettes to this inventory of items will drive even more sales underground- putting more companies and jobs at risk. So the consequence would be lost jobs and lost tax revenues to federal, state and local governments. Where will they turn to make up the shortfall? Unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettes is a bad idea. Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs and taxes for illegal jobs and a thriving contraband market will have negative effects on public health. We respectfully request that the FDA consider these comments when developing regulations, policies and guidance related to menthol in cigarettes. Smoker Friendly appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on matters impacting its members. We look forward to continuing to engage the agency on these matters in the future.

There are thousands of workers dependent upon tobacco from the mountains to the Coastal Plains. While many citizens will debate the health related impacts of tobacco, it is a vital commercial product for our state. Tobacco is heavily regulated in a manner allowing individuals to make an informed and conscious choice in deciding whether to consume the product. Still today in a highly regulated environment, tobacco is important to keeping many North Carolinians employed and working.In addition to the impact on working families throughout our state, a ban on menthol cigarettes would impact law enforcement and state tax revenues. A menthol ban would create a black market for the product, divert finite resources (time, money and personnel) from core law enforcement activities, create a loss of significant tax revenue to support general government needs collected on legitimate regulated sales, and hurt small businesses. Additionally, a ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to job loss having a detrimental economic impact on a state built upon a strong tobacco heritage. Therefore, we respectfully request you carefully review this policy and adequately study the consequential impacts a ban would have on our industry and the economy.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0267,"Because I am confident that between the FDA's own Scientific Advisory Committee report, the additional report commissioned by the CTP, and the layers of comments from many others have provided ample evidence of the negative public health effects of continuing to allow the tobacco industry to use menthol in cigarettes, I want to speak to the context of this decision within the wider public health community. Across the world, many other countries which are now beginning to actively contemplate developing real plans to end the tobacco epidemic are awaiting this decision and are likely to follow suit if FDA acts to ban menthol. Menthol's effects on smoking initiation among youth, its cooling properties which encourage deeper inhalation, and the widespread misimpression (furthered for years by marketing but persisting as folk belief even after such marketing ceased) that menthol cigarettes offer a health advantage are reason enough to act, and to act expeditiously. Recently published research suggests that delay in banning menthol is impairing progress in the US. Many smokers of menthol cigarettes also say they would be likely to quit if menthol was banned. This is a good thing. Of course the tobacco industry will object and likely sue to stop or, failing that, delay implementation. They will do this for every policy that threatens their profits. This is not a reason for government to fail in its duty to protect citizens from what are fundamentally defective products.

The company I work for, Consolidated Trucking, Inc., is a small, family-owned business in the Fairfield, Ohio area. Many of my co-workers are long-tenured, some of whom I have worked with over two decades, while some others have worked in this business their entire adult lives. Many of them I consider good friends; others, family.Our company, formerly called Flanigan Drayage, has been around since 1898, when we made our deliveries via horse and buggy. Therefore, we have a long history of employing individuals and paying our fair share of taxes into our local, state and federal economies. And like many companies since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, we have struggled. You may or may not be aware that many trucking companies were hit particularly hard by the crisis, and many did not make it.Consolidated did, but we lost some employees on the way. Truly, it was a difficult time, but we have weathered the storm thus far and have begun to find our footing. My fear, then, is that significant regulations or a ban on menthol in cigarettes will have the unintended consequence of putting a company that has been around for over two centuries out of business, one that employs many of my friends and family members.And for what reason?Does the science truly support the need for menthol cigarettes to be regulated differently from non-menthol cigarettes?Isnâ€™t it unlikely that the millions of adults that smoke menthol cigarettes will stop overnight?I believe it is more likely that an already thriving, well-documented contraband industry will only fill in the gap for those that prefer menthol cigarettes, and with that comes all the concomitant problems: cigarettes that arenâ€™t FDA regulated, arenâ€™t taxed, arenâ€™t kept out of the hands of our youth, not to mention the probability of increased spending on law enforcement, court costs and prisons.I hereby ask you today to consider the impact that the banning or strict regulation of menthol in cigarettes would have on businesses such as the one I work for and others like ours.

Although from a public health perspective smoking is of huge concern, the leading cause for lung and throat cancers, cardiovascular disease, strokes, and death, I disagree with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposal for potential regulation of menthol in cigarettes. The FDAâ€™s decision was based health risks alone and did not take into account other societal consequences that may occur as a result of this policy. The demand for menthol cigarettes will not simply disappear after than ban. A black market of contraband would increase if the FDA bans menthol cigarettes because the black market which already exists for cigarettes is extremely profitable. As a result, there would be a significant increase in criminal activity. Cigarette smuggling from other countries or other states is already widespread. If this regulation comes into law, the increase in the black market would allow criminal enterprises to flourish since the smuggling networks and means are already in place. In addition, a significant contraband market may fuel more organized criminal organizations, as occurred during the period of alcohol prohibition in the United States. Therefore, law enforcement agencies would have an increased burden to monitor and enforce even more types of tobacco activity. Law enforcement does not need yet another negative element detrimentally impacting public safety which they will have to oversee.

We urge the FDA to ban menthol in cigarettes and help reduce the vast, avoidable differences in health that separate Americans by race and wealth.For 16 years, Prevention Institute has worked to improve health and safety outcomes for all by encouraging the development of policies and practices that prevent illness and injury before they occur. Earlier this year, PI partnered with the California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) to host a health equity summit with chronic disease professionals and national, state, and local stakeholders. Summit participants made a ban on menthol cigarettes one of 11 strategies to reduce tobacco-related disparities in California.Menthol Cigarettes Pose an Undue Burden on the Health of Youth and Communities of ColorHeart disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke are the most common causes of illness, disability, and death. Many of these conditions are more common, diagnosed later and result in worse outcomes for people of color. While smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease across many communities, young people and people of color are disproportionately impacted. This is especially true for menthol cigarettes.Manufacturers use menthol to mask the harshness of tobacco, make it more palatable and entice new generations to smoke. Manufacturers market menthol cigarettes to communities of color, especially African Americans, offering discounts. As a result, young people, African Americans and other people of color are more likely to smoke menthols. As the FDA's July 2013 report said, menthol cigarettes pose a greater harm to public health than non-menthol cigarettes. Menthol in cigarettes leads to an increase in new users. Nearly half of all teen smokers smoke menthols. Menthol smokers are also less able to quit than non-menthol smokers. Broad Public Support for Banning Menthol in CigarettesA large portion of the public, including menthol smokers, support a ban on menthol cigarettes. Nearly half of menthol smokers responding to a survey supported or didnâ€™t oppose a ban. A national study found that many menthol smokers would quit smoking if menthol cigarettes were prohibited, especially African Americans and women.Across the country, local governments are developing strategies to curb the sale and use of menthol products. Chicagoâ€™s Board of Health is collecting public input on ways to reduce the use of menthol. The San Jose City Council voted 8-3 in April 2013 to urge the FDA to ban menthol cigarettes. Advocates like the American Lung Association, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, and Save Lives: Ban Menthol Cigarettes Campaign are leading the push for a ban on menthol. Prohibiting Menthol in Cigarettes Can Protect Public HealthThe goal of the public health standard mandated by The Tobacco Control Act is to reduce the number of people who die or are harmed by tobacco products. Smokers live shorter, less healthy lives than non-smokers. Because menthol tends to boost smoking initiation and inhibit cessation, we believe meeting the standard requires that menthol be banned from cigarettes. The tobacco industry has claimed that a ban on menthol would reduce tax revenue and cause job losses. At Prevention Institute, we support efforts that promote a flourishing economy but believe economic activity shouldnâ€™t come at the cost of peopleâ€™s health. Our workforce, our economy, our healthcare costs and our childrenâ€™s future depend on all people living in healthy, thriving communities.Based on the negative public health impact of menthol in cigarettes and its especially harmful impact on youth and communities of color, Prevention Institute urges the FDA to add menthol to the list of additives prohibited in the flavoring of cigarettes.ConclusionPrevention Institute has a long history of working to reduce tobacco use. Even before he founded the institute, our executive director, Larry Cohen, was a key leader in the effort to create policy change that limits smoking. He helped develop the first local ordinances in California that banned smoking in restaurants and other public places. Today, Prevention Institute continues to support strategies to create healthy, tobacco-free environments. We recognize the need to work across sectors, drawing upon the resources and capacities of individuals, organizations, networks and agencies to develop comprehensive solutions. Prevention Institute thanks the FDA for the chance to comment on the health benefits of removing menthol from tobacco products and commends the agency for working to address the health impacts of menthol in tobacco products.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0325,"â€œDear FDA Staffâ€,My self and my employees responsibly sell tobacco products to adult customers and work diligently to comply with state and federal laws regarding the sale of tobacco. In passing the Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the law that authorized the FDA to regulate tobacco products, Congress specifically allowed menthol to be used in cigarettes. Since this federal law regulates all cigarettes, there is no need to issue additional regulations that would ban or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes. The current federal regulations that apply to all cigarettes, including menthol cigarettes, are sufficient. Additional regulations on the sale and distribution of menthol cigarettes are not necessary. The current FDA regulations that retailers must comply with to sell cigarettes apply equally to non-menthol and menthol cigarettes. If the sale of menthol cigarettes was banned in the United States, a black market will emerge for menthol cigarettes. Illicit trade in lower taxed or un taxed cigarettes already exists from state to state and a ban on menthol cigarettes will only provide a similar opportunity for criminal elements to establish a black market for menthol cigarettes. Fostering the illicit sale of menthol cigarettes will put the public at risk due to more illegal activity. Rather than protecting the public health, a black market in menthol cigarettes puts the public in harms way as a result of more widespread organized crime. While retailers are on the front lines of preventing the sale of cigarettes to minors, the black market does not operate within the law or any sense of public responsibility. Instead of menthol cigarette sales taking place in licensed and regulated retail stores, a ban on menthol cigarettes will lead to smuggled menthol cigarettes being sold on the streets without black market profiteers being concerned with checking someoneâ€™s identification to ensure that they are of legal age. Illegal sales of menthol cigarettes on the black market will undermine the FDAâ€™s goal of protecting the public health. Rather than further the progress that retailers have made in preventing cigarette sales to underage youth, the availability of menthol cigarettes on the black market will provide minors a source for cigarettes that is easily accessible. This result is contradictory to the FDAâ€™s goal of reducing youth access to tobacco products. How can the FDA reconcile proposing a potential ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes to protect the public health when the agencyâ€™s own preliminary scientific evaluation of menthol cigarettes released in July of this year concludes: â€œFrom the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is not associated with an increase in disease risk to the user compared to non-menthol cigarette smokers.â€ Based on this conclusion, banning menthol cigarettes would only force adults who purchase menthol cigarettes to seek out illegal menthol cigarettes on the contraband market. Overly restrictive regulations or a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes will have a severe negative impact on retailers and wholesalers. A ban on menthol cigarette sales will result in a significant drop in legal cigarette sales due to customers seeking out black market menthol cigarettes. This will put more jobs at risk and even the prospect of business closures. The result is lost jobs, lost cigarette tax revenue to state governments and the federal government, and greater expenditures by law enforcement officials to combat what will be a widespread black market in menthol cigarettes.Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs with illegal jobs created by a rampant black market with no resulting benefit to the public health.",sell,Negative,Negative,Negative

Box 14433Stanford, CA 94309November 13, 2013Food and Drug AdministrationDivision of Dockets Management (HFA-305)5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061Rockville, MD 20852RE:Docket No.: FDA-2013-N-0521-0079Dear Commissioners,1. Should FDA consider establishing a tobacco product standard for menthol in menthol cigarettes? If so, what allowable level of menthol (e.g., maximum or minimum) would be appropriate for the protection of the public health?A proposed ban on mentholated cigarettes, without further consideration of alternative regulatory approaches, might preclude the possibility of permanently ending cigarette related deaths. Specifically, were the government to regulate tobacco by requiring that the level of nicotine be reduced to non-addictive levels in cigarettes, mentholated cigarettesâ€”precisely because they are associated with increased smokingâ€”may aid smokers in their quest to overcome nicotine addiction and possibly preventing others from acquiring it. Because the statutorily mandated Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committeeâ€™s (TPSAC) report does not consider the effect of menthol in such below threshold level cigarettes, any such regulation banning mentholated cigarettes would be premature and could end up doing more harm than good in terms of protecting public health. The FDAâ€™s Advance Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking (re a tobacco product standard for menthol in menthol cigarettes) follows the publication of the TPSAC report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health. In this report, TPSAC concludes that the availability of menthol cigarettes does have certain negative effectsâ€”such as increasing initiation of smoking or reducing the success of cessationâ€”but does not have a significant effect on risk for disease outcomes. According to TPSAC, the resultant increase in the prevalence of smoking would represent a negative public health impact.An Alternate Approach: Non-Addictive CigarettesNon-addictive cigarettes are obviously feasible; tobacco companies have occasionally produced and marketed them. A large percentage of smokers report that they would like to quit and would naturally opt, in their attempt to quit, for the non-addictive cigarette option. Extrapolating from the findings of TPSAC, mentholated cigarettes would similarly make the smoking of tobacco cigarettes, containing below addiction levels of nicotine, more palpable. A regulation that bans mentholated cigarettes would most likely result in reducing the efficacy of any attempts to reduce the level of nicotine in cigarettes below addiction level.In 1994, an article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine that proposed reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes as a way to avert addiction. Neal L. Benowitz & Jack E. Henningfield, Establishing a Nicotine Threshold for Addiction: The Implications for Tobacco Regulation, 331 New Eng. J. Med. 123, 124-25 (1994). According to this articleâ€™s authors, studies have shown that 5 mg of nicotine per day is a threshold level that can readily establish and sustain addiction. They further conclude: â€œassuming that the estimated target daily dose of nicotine should be 5 mg or less to avert addiction and that a young person may smoke up to 30 cigarettes per day, one can conclude that a maximal available (i.e. systemic) dose of 0.17 mg of nicotine per cigarette is the threshold level for a less-addicting cigarette.â€Under the Act, the FDA has the power to establish â€œtobacco product standards,â€ Â§ 907, including â€œprovisions, where appropriate, for nicotine yields of the product.â€ Â§ 907(a)(4)(A)(i). The only limitation on this power is that the FDA may not issue a regulation â€œrequiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.â€ Â§ 907(d)(3)(B). In theory, the agency can set the level of nicotine allowed in cigarettes at such a level that addiction would be greatly decreased. If menthol was able to aid in making these cigarettes more attractiveâ€”that is to say, if menthol does in fact increase the likelihood that smokers will continue to smokeâ€”it will aid in the transition from addictive to non-addictive cigarettes. In such a situation, menthol as an additive would reduce the demand for contraband nicotine-rich cigarettes by possibly keeping smokers satisfied with their reduced nicotine cigarettes. In any case, TPSAC does not consider the effect of menthol in cigarettes with nicotine levels below the threshold level for addiction. The study does not address whether or not menthol has anesthetic, counterirritant, or other attractive properties to such an extent that a very low nicotine but mentholated cigarette would still satisfy at least those smokers that are looking to quit. For this reason, the studyâ€™s conclusions must be viewed with suspicion.",level of menthol,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

(PMI) submits these comments in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)â€™s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on the use of menthol in cigarettes. PMI does not sell products in the U.S. However, PMI appreciates FDAâ€™s leadership role in regulatory decision-making and recognizes that FDAâ€™s approach to regulating menthol may be relied upon by other countries. We are encouraged by FDAâ€™s stated commitment to seek additional information and research on menthol and to base its decision-making on â€œrigorous science.â€ Given this high burden and the complexity of issues before FDA, we agree with FDA that it is important to consider all available evidence on menthol cigarettes, including international data. Therefore, we respectfully submit our responses to several of the questions posed in the ANPRM. As an initial matter, PMI agrees with the assessment in FDAâ€™s â€œPreliminary Scientific Evaluation of the Possible Public Health Effects of Menthol Versus Nonmenthol Cigarettes (PSE)â€ that â€œthe weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is not associated with an increase in disease risk to the user compared to nonmenthol cigarette smokers.â€ At the same time, however, PMI believes FDAâ€™s preliminary conclusion that there is a â€œlikely associationâ€ between menthol cigarettes and smoking initiation, dependence, cessation, and physiological response to tobacco smoke and â€œthat menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettesâ€ is not supported by sufficient evidence, including the very evidence cited in the PSE. As discussed in more detail in PMIâ€™s comments on FDAâ€™s PSE, which are being submitted together with its responses to the ANPRM questions, when one considers the entirety of the evidence on menthol cigarettes and FDAâ€™s approach to evaluating that evidence, there is insufficient support for the hypothesis that menthol in cigarettes increases the risk or harm from smoking above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes because: (1) it is clear based on the scientific evidence and FDAâ€™s own preliminary conclusions that menthol in cigarettes is not associated with increased smoke toxicity, an increase in disease risk to the user or an increased exposure to nicotine compared to nonmenthol cigarette smokers; (2) FDAâ€™s approach of discounting significant evidence not in favor of its preliminary conclusions on initiation, dependence, cessation, physiology and the marketing of menthol cigarettes as a smoother alternative is not justified; (3) even taking FDAâ€™s evaluation of the evidence at face value, FDA arrives only at findings of â€œlikely associationsâ€ between menthol in cigarettes and the specific impacts; and (4) even a strong association would on its own not be sufficient to infer a causal link to the effect that menthol in cigarettes poses an increased public health risk over and above that seen with any cigarette.In addition to FDAâ€™s obligation to ensure that there is an adequate evidentiary basis for any potential tobacco product standard for menthol cigarettes, FDA has a duty to carefully consider the wide-ranging policy implications of such a standard, and in particular a ban on all menthol cigarettes, which is one of the options under consideration. As discussed in detail in PMIâ€™s response to Question C.3, international data and experience show that banning an entire product category, and especially one as large as the menthol segment in the U.S., would result in a significant increase in illicit trade.Accordingly, we respectfully ask FDA to consider PMIâ€™s comments in FDAâ€™s continuing assessment of menthol cigarettes, and we remain available to answer any questions FDA may have with respect to our submission and the international data and evidence we provide.",regulating menthol,Positive,Positive,Positive
FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0357,"Menthol Cigarettes Usage Among African AmericansWhile on my public health rotation I researched tobacco usage among African Americans in the Solano county and the advertising tactics by the tobacco industry targeting them. Being African American I became alarmed and disheartened at my findings of the incessant advertisement of mentholated cigarettes in African American neighborhoods. The county reported up to 23% of its populations as smokers with starting age of smoking as early as the age of 12. This issue is further complicated by the prevalence of other health risks reported: 21% are obese, 22% have hypertension and 6.5% have diabetes. One in every five deaths is cigarette related in Solano County.Although the FDA has intervened to provide safety and protection on drug related issues, little has been done regarding cigarette usage. FDA did ban fruit and candy flavoring in cigarettes however, tobacco companies have never relented on their efforts to pollute our society with their products. They found another devise, a new strategy to lure more youths into smoking cigarette, which was the addition of menthol to cigarettes. Advertisements of cigarette are strategized purposely to target the young adults and children in African American communities. Even though clinical research studies have disproved the claims of the tobacco companies on the benefits of mentholated cigarette, well-tailored cigarette messages indicating false benefits are continually being promoted by this industry. As a result a common myth believed by the American African population is that menthol cigarettes have medicinal benefits and are less harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. Taste and sensation of menthol cigarette, which masks the taste of tobacco is yet another devise the tobacco industry utilizes to prey on the African American youths.Further studies document African American neighborhoods get targeted with more advertisements for the leading brands of menthol cigarettes than in other communities. Most alarming is that advertisements are propagated near the high schools. Convenience stores and gas stations in poorer neighborhoods have advertisements strategically placed in areas where they are easily seen at eye level on the widows and at cash registers.Recently, a study was conducted to compare cigarette advertisement exposure to different racial youth groups. The African American youths recognized the Newport cigarette, menthol flavored cigarettes more than other racial groups. This result was attributed to uncontrolled exposure of advertisements regarding this product in their communities. It is not surprising there is an increased smoking initiation among the African American youths. To their credit the Solano Board of Supervisors passed a resolution to ban the sale of menthol cigarettes. The Solano Tobacco Prevention and Education program, its allied and other local groups then signed a petition and sent it to the FDA in 2013 requesting a ban on menthol cigarettes. As Pharmacists we are obligated to be concerned about the health care of all the members in our community. I encourage involvement in local tobacco prevention and education programs that promote a healthier life style of living for all communities. I also encourage peers and licensed pharmacists to write to the FDA. The greater number of petitions to the FDA regarding mentholated cigarettes will catch their attention and possibly ban this health hazard. I would like to give acknowledgement to Aglaia Panos Pharm D and Fred Mayer RPh, MPH for their guidance and public health education to a future health care provider like myself.

AbstractBackground: Studies have shown that individuals who smoke menthol cigarettes are less likely to quit smoking and more likely to relapse during a quit attempt. The current study investigated menthol cigarette use as a potential predictor of smoking cessation outcomes in a sample of treatment-seeking smokers. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of low-dose naltrexone augmentation of nicotine replacement designed to examine smoking cessation and postcessation weight gain in weight-concerned smokers (Toll, B. A., White, M., Wu, R., Meandzija, B., Jatlow, P., Makuch, R., & Oâ€™Malley, S. S. (2010). Low-dose naltrexone augmentation of nicotine replacement for smoking cessation with reduced weight gain: A randomized trial. Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 111, 200â€“206. doi:10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2010.04.015). Results: Analyses revealed that menthol use predicted lower quit rates. Among menthol smokers (N = 61), 13% were abstinent at Week 26, and among nonmenthol smokers (N = 105), 30% were abstinent (Wald = 4.15, p = .04; odds ratio [OR] = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.04â€“5.90). Further, menthol smokers who quit smoking gained significantly more weight at Week 26 (M = 14.87 lbs, SD = 9.08; t(37) = â€“2.22, p = .03) than nonmenthol smokers who quit (M = 7.95 lbs, SD = 7.53). Conclusions: Menthol cigarette use has not typically been evaluated as a predictor of smoking cessation outcomes, but emerging evidence suggests that consumption of menthol may make cessation more difficult. This study adds to the literature supporting the claim that smoking menthol cigarettes can have adverse effects on smoking cessation efforts and on other cessation-related outcomes, such as postcessation weight gain. http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/09/07/ntr.ntt137.full.pdf+html",adverse effects,Positive,Positive,Positive

Menthol cigarettes are unequal-opportunity killers that disproportionately hook young people, African-Americans and other people of color, harming their health and reducing their life expectancy. We urge the FDA to ban menthol in cigarettes and help reduce the vast, avoidable differences in health that separate Americans by race and wealth.For 16 years, Prevention Institute has worked to improve health and safety outcomes for all by encouraging the development of policies and practices that prevent illness and injury before they occur. Earlier this year, PI partnered with the California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) to host a health equity summit with chronic disease professionals and national, state, and local stakeholders. Summit participants made a ban on menthol cigarettes one of 11 strategies to reduce tobacco-related disparities in California.Menthol Cigarettes Pose an Undue Burden on the Health of Youth and Communities of ColorHeart disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke are the most common causes of illness, disability, and death. Many of these conditions are more common, diagnosed later and result in worse outcomes for people of color. While smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease across many communities, young people and people of color are disproportionately impacted. This is especially true for menthol cigarettes.Manufacturers use menthol to mask the harshness of tobacco, make it more palatable and entice new generations to smoke. Manufacturers market menthol cigarettes to communities of color, especially African Americans, offering discounts. As a result, young people, African Americans and other people of color are more likely to smoke menthols. As the FDA's July 2013 report said, menthol cigarettes pose a greater harm to public health than non-menthol cigarettes. Menthol in cigarettes leads to an increase in new users. Nearly half of all teen smokers smoke menthols. Menthol smokers are also less able to quit than non-menthol smokers. Broad Public Support for Banning Menthol in CigarettesA large portion of the public, including menthol smokers, support a ban on menthol cigarettes. Nearly half of menthol smokers responding to a survey supported or didnâ€™t oppose a ban. A national study found that many menthol smokers would quit smoking if menthol cigarettes were prohibited, especially African Americans and women.Across the country, local governments are developing strategies to curb the sale and use of menthol products. Chicagoâ€™s Board of Health is collecting public input on ways to reduce the use of menthol. The San Jose City Council voted 8-3 in April 2013 to urge the FDA to ban menthol cigarettes.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0381,"Department of Health and Human Services â€“ Food and Drug AdministrationDocket No. FDAâ€“2013â€“Nâ€“0521Dear Mr. Mitchell Zeller:I am writing to comment on the Food and Drug Administration proposed rule on menthol cigarettes. First, I would like to commend the Agency for its consideration of the public health in this matter. By expanding the scope of tobacco flavorings impacted by regulations flowing from the 2009 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Agency has the potential to both protect human health and ward off a potential trade dispute, as will be discussed below. By taking proper measures against menthol in cigarettes, the FDA will save the United States taxpayer money.As I am sure the Agency is aware, any limitations on menthol in cigarettes will need to be compliant with international trade rules and norms. Soon after the FDA banned other flavors of cigarettes (including fruit and clove flavors) in 2009, Indonesia, as a major exporter of the cloves used to make clove cigarettes, brought the U.S. â€“ Clove Cigarettes (Appellate Body report: WT/DS406/AB/R, 4 April 2012) dispute before the World Trade Organization (WTO). When the WTO Appellate Body decided that menthol and clove cigarettes qualified as â€œlike productsâ€ under Article 2.1 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which was part of Indonesiaâ€™s argument that the United States was giving preferential treatment in trade regulations to its own menthol product, the United States lost the U.S. â€“ Clove Cigarettes case. If the United States does not take sufficient action towards banning menthol flavoring in cigarettes (thus showing that it is not treating the menthol flavoring any differently from clove flavoring), it is likely that Indonesia will pursue trade remedies against the US. In fact, as of August 23, Indonesia has requested authorization to retaliate against the United States in this matter.Accordingly, in addition to attempting to maximize public health benefits by weighing the considerations contemplated in the FDAâ€™s Scientific Evaluation, the Agency should also consider trade implications. Since the Agency enacted an outright ban against clove cigarettes in 2009, it seems unlikely that anything much less than a ban or graduated ban on menthol in cigarettes would satisfy U.S. trade obligations to the WTO and Indonesia following the U.S. â€“Clove Cigarettes case. A tobacco product standard for menthol in cigarettes which still allows a certain amount of menthol or any similar flavoring to be added to cigarettes would not go far enough, at least as long as the WTO is concerned. Therefore, I strongly recommend that the FDA consider banning menthol flavoring in cigarettes outright. Sincerely,Kate ScherschelJ.D.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0384,"This comment is in response to Tobacco Product Standards questions #2 and #3, on the potential regulation of other types of additives and flavors, and the potential regulation of other types of tobacco products.In addition to regulating the use of menthol in cigarettes, the FDA should study the effects of additives in smokeless â€œnon-combustibleâ€ tobacco products, especially dipping tobacco, or moist snuff. And the study should not be limited to menthol additives in smokeless tobacco, but to all additive flavorings. Dipping tobacco has been show to cause a multitude of mouth cancers including cancer of the tongue, lip, cheek, gums, and on the base and roof of the mouth. And while with cigarettes weâ€™re used to seeing the primary additive as menthol, in smokeless tobacco that is not the case. Companies that make dipping tobacco use a range of different flavors to attract customers. For example, Grizzly, Kodiak, Longhorn, Stokerâ€™s, and Husky all make a wintergreen and a mint flavored dipping tobacco. Kayak makes wintergreen, mint, apple, peach, and grape. Timber Wolf makes wintergreen, cool wintergreen, mint, apple, and peach. Skoal makes wintergreen, mint, spearmint, Xtra mint, Xtra wintergreen, apple, cherry, berry, citrus, peach, and vanilla. And Copenhagen makes wintergreen, mint, smooth hickory, and a whiskey blend flavored dip. Due to the high number of children under the age of eighteenâ€”especially in certain regions of the countryâ€”who view dipping tobacco as a safe alternative to cigarettes, it is likely that many of them are initiated into the habit with the multiplicity of fruit and mint flavored products. In fact, in certain communities, the fruit flavors (peach, apple, grape, berry, citrus) are seen as a good â€œstarterâ€ dip, before usersâ€”still teenagersâ€”graduate to the range of mint flavors (mint, wintergreen, cool wintergreen, Xtra mint, Xtra wintergreen) which are known to be higher in nicotine content. This range of flavors potentially makes dipping tobacco more palatable for young users. Like in cigarettes, mint flavors could be reducing the irritation and harshness associated with smokeless tobacco.While the advertising of menthol cigarette is the subject of review in this current comment period, the marketing of flavored smokeless tobacco is clearly also an important issue for further studyâ€”one need only walk into a convenience store in some areas and see the rows of bright multi-colored tins displayed as if they were candy. As part of the FDAâ€™s implementation of the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, a study should be prepared on the effect and the marketing of the range of available dipping tobacco flavor additives. In the end, regulation might be appropriate.",potential regulation,Positive,Positive,Positive

Banning menthol as a flavor in tobacco products would cut down on youth initiation of these products. Youth usually find regular tobacco flavoring to harsh, so the menthol allows them to enjoy the taste of these products. Also, flavors such as, chocolate, strawberry and vanilla were outlawed in cigarettes, menthol should have been included in this ban as it gives tobacco a mint flavor. When looking at banning menthol tobacco products, the law should include all current and future tobacco products as the tobacco industry will find a loop hole as they did with creating little cigarettes to still include flavoring in. Wording and inclusion on future products is important to remember. Banning menthol would decrease youth initiation and also smoking rates among minorities that favor this flavor in tobacco products.","youth,flavor",Positive,Positive,Positive

The comments in this letter are being submitted on behalf of our company and its employees regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.One of our major concerns with a question posed by the FDA in the Advance Notice of Rulemakingâ€ is the possibility of a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes. In response to the question, clearly an illicit market for menthol cigarettes would arise if the FDA banned the sale of menthol cigarettes.Illicit tobacco markets are pervasive today and are mainly due to unreasonably high cigarette tax rates at the local and state levels. A high tax environment creates the perfect conditions for black market sales of cigarettes. If FDA imposes overly restrictive regulations on menthol in cigarettes or bans the sale of the product altogether, the conditions will be ripe for black market criminals to fill the on-going demand for mentholated cigarettes.Such a black market would further strain the limited resources of local, state and even federal law enforcement authorities. Federal and state law enforcement efforts already are stretched to respond to the current level of crime, let alone a whole new wave of black market cigarette activity. The FDA needs to be sensitive to the very real likelihood of fostering illegal cigarette sales if a ban on menthol cigarettes is proposed and subsequently adopted. Moreover, contraband markets have a negative effect on public health because they undermine efforts to prevent underage smoking. There is no way to monitor whether illicit cigarettes are sold to underage youths and black market sellers are unconcerned about asking for photo identification before making a sale. An outright prohibition on the sale of menthol cigarettes would have a severe impact on our company, our employees and the retail sector of the economy as well. Many thousands of working Americans, including Farner-Bocken employees, rely on the sale of menthol cigarettes for their jobs as do so many manufacturing employees and workers in the retail industry. A black market would drain legal sales of cigarettes away from law-abiding retailers and wholesalers only to allow criminals to profit from the underground sale of menthol cigarettes.These predictions of the negative consequences resulting from a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes come from experience. Wholesalers already face underground market competition in many product areas. Besides the lost wholesale and retail jobs, the consequences of a menthol ban would extend to lost tax revenues for the federal, state and local governments. Where will these governments make up the shortfall in tax revenue as a result of a nationwide black market? Banning menthol cigarettes is an unreasonable policy position that will only lead to widespread illicit trade and crime at the expense of licensed wholesalers and retailers. More importantly, a prohibition of menthol cigarettes may likely have an unintended negative impact on the public health, something the FDA is tasked with protecting.Sincerely yours,Paul FrancisFarner-Bocken Company",regulate menthol,Negative,Negative,Negative

We write today to urge the FDA to remove menthol cigarettes from the market as quickly as possible.Tobacco use is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths each year in the United States and is the leading preventable cause of death. A quarter of all cigarettes sold are menthol cigarettes, which studies show are preferred by younger smokers and new smokers. Since almost 9 out of 10 (88%) adult smokers began smoking before age 18, it will save lives to make smoking as unappealing as possible for teenagers and young adults. Mentholâ€™s â€œcooling effectâ€ does the opposite: it makes smoking as palatable (perhaps more palatable) to young people and nonsmokers as candy flavoring, which was banned in 2009 under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. According to the FDAâ€™s Preliminary Scientific Evaluation of the Possible Public Health Effects of Menthol Versus Nonmenthol Cigarettes, â€œthe weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased initiation and progression to regular of cigarette smoking.â€ Not only are menthol cigarettes a starter product for youth, they are harder to quit because they are likely associated with: 1) â€œincreased dependence,â€ and 2) â€œreduced success in smoking cessation, especially among African American menthol smokers.â€ For these reasons, we strongly agree with the FDA conclusions that â€œmenthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes.â€ The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC), before which we testified, concluded over two years ago that â€œremoval of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.â€ A conservative modeling scenario published in a peer-reviewed medical journal estimated that over 320,000 deathsâ€”most of them among African Americansâ€”could be averted by 2050 had menthol been banned in 2011 as recommended.(1) The FDA must not drag its feet any longer. The decision to extend the comment period an additional two months itself cost thousands of lives. The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund represents the millions of American families whose lives have been touched by cancer, and our mission is to gather and scrutinize research to determine how programs and policies can reduce the incidence of cancer and improve treatment options for cancer patients. Our scientific analysis indicates that hundreds of thousands of lives will be saved when the FDA removes menthol cigarettes from the market, and we strongly urge the FDA to protect the public health by implementing a final rule to do so.Sincerely,Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund(1) Levy, et. al., Modeling the future effects of a menthol ban on reduced smoking prevalence and deaths averted in the United States.

FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0395,"See attached Re:Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521 Menthol in CigarettesThe following is submitted in response to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FDA-2013-N-0521) with regard to banning, or tightly regulating, menthol-flavored cigarettes. The FDA should give careful consideration to the risks of illicit-market activity as a result of whatever action it takes, and to additional actions that might control those risks.When it instructed the FDA to consider a ban on menthol cigarettes in the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, Congress also instructed the FDA to consider the illicit-market problem. Neither the TPSAC report on menthol nor this yearâ€™s FDA report does so adequately.The problem is not a minor one. Of course illicit markets reduce the benefits of controls by facilitating evasion. But they also create their own health harms, social harms, and budget costs. As the illicit drug markets demonstrate, those harms can be large. One potential supply route for illicit menthol cigarettes might be across the U.S.-Mexican border, where violent multinational organized crime groups dominate drug smuggling.Peter Reuter has pointed out that a ban on cigarettes, which would surely reduce smoking, would also create a substantial illicit market, and that the gains from smoking reduction need to be weighed against the costs of illicit markets. In a new paper (attached), Angela Hawken, Jonathan Kulick, and James Prieger extend that point by analyzing the ways in which taxes and regulations can also generate systematic evasion, with qualitatively similar side effects. The size of the illicit market that might arise in the face of a menthol ban depends on many unknowns about supply of various kinds (domestic illicit production, overseas illicit production, smuggling, and retailing) and demand. It is possible but not certain that many current menthol smokers would resort to â€œhome mentholationâ€ of non-menthol cigarettes. The size of the illicit market also depends on related policy choices, including the regulation of products such as flavored e-cigarettes that might compete with illicit menthol cigarettes. There is already a substantial market in tax-evaded cigarettes; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [BATFE] estimates total taxes evaded at $10 billion per year. That illicit activity does not currently receive proportionate enforcement attention; BATFE, the primary federal enforcement agency in this domain, spends less than 2 percent of its budget on tobacco enforcement. A ban on menthol cigarettes would be expected to add to illicit-market demand, to an extent that has not yet been estimated but which might be considerable. Total licit-market retail sales of menthol cigarettes have been estimated at $26B in 2010, larger than the market for any illicit drug except for cannabis and cocaine. Menthol smokers report strong attachment to menthol; in surveys, more than a third say they would quit rather than switch to non-menthol product. The success rate in quit attempts is not high in general, and (as noted by TPSAC) may be even lower for menthol smokers. So it is not possible to rule out the risk that a menthol ban would create a large number of unsuccessful quitters seeking illicit supplies.A menthol ban, even if imperfectly observed, could nevertheless reduce smoking prevalence and thus smoking-related health damage. In order to reach a judgment as to whether a menthol ban would be, on balance, beneficial or harmful to health and other values, gains from reduced smoking would have to be weighed against the losses from expanding the illicit markets. But even with more facts and analysis about illicit demand and supply than are currently in hand, it would not be possible to estimate the benefits and costs of a menthol ban without specifying the accompanying enforcement regime in terms of resources, tactics, and penalties. Timing matters: because of positive-feedback effects in rates of illicit activity, increasing enforcement before increasing illicit-market demand by banning menthol would be expected to produce better outcomes than increasing demand first and then trying to enforce against an already-swollen market. Any move toward a ban ought to be undertaken in consultation with the federal agencies charged with enforcement against illicit tobacco-related activities (BATFE, ATTTB, CBP, FBI), with state and local law-enforcement agencies and Native American governments, and with foreign governments, especially those of Canada and Mexico.I would be happy to answer any questions, and to work with FDA staff toward getting this important decision right.Sincerely yours,Mark A.R.

SRNT is the largest scientific organization dedicated to interdisciplinary nicotine and tobacco research from molecular to societal levels, with an international membership, many of whom have contributed to the scientific evidence on the effects of menthol added to cigarettes.SRNT recognizes that a thorough review of the scientific evidence on the effects of menthol was produced by FDAâ€™s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) and that on July 21, 2011 TPSAC voted to approve its final report and recommendations, which concluded, â€œremoval of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.â€In addition, SRNT recognizes that FDA also subsequently produced an independent â€œPreliminary Evaluation of the Possible Public Health Effects of Menthol Versus Nonmenthol Cigarettes,â€ based on weighing the collective body of evidence for the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health. That report concluded that: â€œConsistent patterns have emerged as a result of FDAâ€™s evaluation of the scientific evidence relevant to the impact of menthol tobacco products on public health. While there is little evidence to suggest that menthol cigarettes are more or less toxic or contribute to more disease risk to the user than nonmenthol cigarettes, adequate data suggest that menthol use is likely associated with increased smoking initiation by youth and young adults. Further, the data indicate that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with greater addiction. Menthol smokers show greater signs of nicotine dependence and are less likely to successfully quit smoking. These findings, combined with the evidence indicating that mentholâ€™s cooling and anesthetic properties can reduce the harshness of cigarette smoke and the evidence indicating that menthol cigarettes are marketed as a smoother alternative to nonmenthol cigarettes, make it likely that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes.â€ (FDA, July 23, 2013)The SRNT Board considers that the reviews of the evidence conducted by TPSAC and by FDA summarized above were thorough, balanced and that their conclusions are based on the best science available. We also note that since the publication of these reports, the more recent evidence that has been published has continued to be broadly consistent with the conclusions of these reports (e.g. Faseru et al, 2013; Reitzel et al, 2013; Rojewski et al, 2013; Dâ€™Silva et al, 2012; Nonnemaker et al, 2013; Giovino et al, 2013). Given the consistent conclusions from the TPSAC review, FDAâ€™s own independent review and of subsequent studies published on menthol in peer-reviewed scientific journals over the past year, the SRNT Board makes the following recommendations:1.FDA should establish a tobacco product standard addressing menthol concentrations in all tobacco products intended to be smoked (i.e. all combusted tobacco products, cigars and tobacco rolling paper, and other menthol products intended for use to flavor tobacco). 2.The new menthol standard should entirely prohibit the sale of a smoked tobacco product containing any detectable menthol, or any other additive known to produce a menthol-like (cooling or anesthetic) sensory effect.3.The new menthol standard should be fully implemented within 12 months from the initial announcement.4.The new menthol standard should be combined with a public education campaign designed to educate the public about the new menthol standard, and to promote smoking cessation services for menthol smokers who want to quit smoking.5.The effects of the new menthol standard should be thoroughly evaluated using the best evaluation and research methods available, including surveillance for switching to non-combustible products and electronic cigarettes if the new menthol standard is not implemented for all tobacco products.We thank you for your consideration of these comments and recommendations and we would be honored to assist you in any way possible in formulating effect new standards for menthol in tobacco products.",effects of menthol,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

This assessment gathered point-of-sale tobacco ads and price promotions data. The data analysis revealed that a 10% difference in a block group's African-American/Black population was associated with 9% (95% confidence interval [CI]=3%, 16%) more tobacco ads. Further, block groups with greater African-American/Black, Asian, people on public assistance or below 150% of the poverty threshold, or people under the age of 18 years, had more ads for menthol brands.

Reg. 44484 (July 24, 2013), to support a ban on menthol in cigarettes and other tobacco products.We request that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assert its authority to require the immediate removal of menthol from all cigarettes, and other tobacco products. Menthol is a flavoring, and like other flavorings added to tobacco, masks the harshness of tobacco on the mouth and throat. This masking is very important in addicting new users, labeled by the tobacco industry as â€œreplacement smokers.â€ Because more than 80 percent of all current adult smokers started before age 18, menthol in tobacco is a pediatric health issue, according to the latest Surgeon Generalâ€™s Report.Removing menthol from cigarettes is one of the most effective actions the FDA can take to improve the publicâ€™s health, and pediatric health in particular. Menthol flavoring in cigarettes plays a major role in increasing youth initiation of smoking and in making smoking appealing to new and current smokers, especially among some racial and ethnic groups targeted by the advertising of menthol tobacco brands. In 2009, Congress and the President recognized the role of flavoring in promoting tobacco use when it banned all flavored cigarettes such as grape, orange, strawberry, coffee, clove, vanilla, and chocolate â€“ but exempted menthol.The FDA needs to include menthol in its list of flavorings banned in cigarettes for the above reasons. To ensure that any FDA action banning menthol is not circumvented, the FDA should also:â€¢Prohibit menthol as an additive at any level.â€¢Prohibit menthol in all tobacco products, not just in cigarettes.â€¢Ban menthol analogs and substitutes in all tobacco products to ensure that the FDAâ€™s ban on menthol does not result in use of unregulated menthol-like alternatives that serve the same purposes as menthol (masking, youth appeal).â€¢Promote appropriate cessation approaches for current menthol users to quit all tobacco products, rather than to switch from a menthol product to a new tobacco product.The evidence is clear. The tobacco industry has a long and well documented history of marketing mentholated brands of cigarettes to new and current users, especially in racial and ethnic populations. The tobacco industry also has a long and well documented history of adapting to bypass the regulation. Please act swiftly to regulate menthol flavoring in all tobacco products, in a way that ensures all current and future tobacco products are not modified to be palatable and appealing to new, young users.

During this time we have focused our efforts on training clinicians how to treat tobacco dependence in safety net community serving clinics and with behavioral health providers who serve the most high risk, high-use consumers of mental health and substance abuse services. These populations continue to smoke at much higher rates than the general population. Many are people of color who have been targeted by the tobacco industry for decades encouraging use of menthol cigarettes, esp. African Americans, who often suffer inordinately higher consequences of tobacco related disease and death, and are also among the highest users of mentholated tobacco products.... starting with teens and continuing through a lifetime of smoking. Research tells us that because the menthol flavoring in cigarettes allows for deeper inhalation and absorption of high levels of nicotine, those who smoke mentholated cigarettes have a harder time quitting. This is certainly born out in our work. Over these years we continue to see that those who smoke menthol cigarettes tend to hang on to their addiction, and seem less able and/or willing to quit. When asked if menthol was banned from cigarettes, would they continue to smoke. Most say NO; they would quit. This attests to the power of this flavoring to keep people hooked on smoking, and by consequence more at risk for dying of tobacco-related disease. We also see menthol as the 'gateway' tobacco flavoring preferred by youth who find it easier to endure the physical discomforts of smoking because menthol masks the throat and lung irritation, and allows more nicotine to reach the brain centers, thus creating addiction after smoking only a few cigarettes. Menthol flavored tobacco products is a sinister, manipulative way to recruit and hook young smokers. The tobacco industry depends on this. I'm writing to express my most earnest request that the FDA, do the right thing, and BAN menthol in tobacco products as a way to protect the public health and eliminate these tobacco products that are so detrimental to those who use them.

The data to support this decision:The TPSAC report on menthol and your recent scientific report outline the public health basis and benefit to removing menthol from all tobacco products. The new Centers For Disease Control report, released this month, outlined the concerning trends among youth and little cigars, hookah, and e-cigarettes â€“ all products that are currently offered in menthol flavoring in Colorado and around the country. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/ The Surgeon General's report on youth and young adult tobacco use outlined the information from the once secret tobacco industry documents on their use of menthol to attract youth.http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2012/As far as the black market, in the letter you recently received from twenty-seven State Attorney's Generals calling for the removal of menthol from cigarettes, it was said â€œThe specter of a black market is often raised to oppose regulation or taxes, but the threat of the emergence of a black market in menthol cigarettes should not be permitted to override the protection of public health.â€ The tobacco industry has used the black argument to oppose price increases, what we know to be one of the most effective strategies for reducing use.Lastly, your decision must be comprehensive and and not rely on the tobacco industry to behave responsibly. A complete removal of menthol, its analogs and substitutes, and any other measure needed to protect public health should be taken. In the the federal RICO case decision against the tobacco industry, Judge Kessler outlined a decades long pattern of deceit by the tobacco companies. She stated â€œDefendants have marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.â€http://publichealthlawcenter.org/topics/special-collections/verdict-findings-united-states-v-philip-morris-collectionYour decision needs to take into account the documented history of the tobacco industry and their disregard for public health and safety.

PMAA member associations are represented in every state capital with the exception of Alaska. It is our position that additional restrictions on menthol cigarettes are not justified and will have several harmful unintended consequences.It is our view that tobacco retailers are extremely conscientious in efforts to combat underage smoking. We believe FDA and state agency inspection statistics confirm the success of retailer efforts. Because very few youth are purchasing cigarettes from convenience stores, rather than restrict menthol, FDA would be using resources more effectively to research how youth are obtaining cigarettes? It is our view that adult-aged friends or family members are the predominant contributor to underage smoking. We believe adopting new strategies to limit the casual ( and illegal) sources of cigarettes would be far more effective than restricting menthol.Without question, restricting menthol cigarettes will contribute to the expansion of criminal enterprises and illicit tobacco markets. Menthol cigarettes comprise a significant portion of the cigarette marketplace and that demand will be exploited by criminals. Additional criminal activity will create a need for increased spending on law enforcement and all the related judicial processes. While menthol restrictions will increase government operating costs, it will dramatically reduce state and federal government revenues. Two examples are Michigan and Illinois. Both states are suffering with unemployment over 9% and decreasing government revenues. If Menthol were banned, Michigan would lose $515 million and Illinois $397 million. These are the total menthol related revenues from both the master settlements and excise taxes. The ban would increase law enforcement costs, dramatically reduce state revenues and do practically nothing to reduce underage smoking.",reduce state revenues,Negative,Negative,Negative

Director, Center for Tobacco ProductsFood and Drug Administration9200 Corporate BoulevardRockville, MD 20850Re: Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521 Rulemaking for Menthol in Cigarettes and Tobacco Products Dear Director Zeller; Respiratory Health Association (RHA) is pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the FDA proposed rulemaking regarding menthol in cigarettes and tobacco products. Removing menthol from tobacco products would greatly reduce the toll of tobacco and improve health outcomes for our communities. A cornerstone of the work of Respiratory Health Association has been to reduce the toll of tobacco on our community. RHA was one of the leaders in the successful efforts to adopt smoke-free laws at the local and state level and to increase taxes of tobacco products to reduce the impact of tobacco upon our community. We are proud to collaborate on policy strategies to decrease tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke, with concentrated efforts aimed at high-burden population groups. Evidence has shown that tobacco companies have been preying upon vulnerable populations and getting them addicted to their deadly products. Menthol leads to increased use of tobacco and is a starter product for youth tobacco addiction especially among LGBT, Hispanic and black youth. Almost all smokers in the U.S. begin smoking as adolescents. Research shows that newer smokers favor menthol cigarettes. Menthol can mask the harshness of cigarette smoke, providing a cooling sensation that has been found to appeal particularly to new, young smokers. While overall smoking rates in the U.S. are declining, use of menthol cigarettes, particularly among young smokers, is rising. Menthol cigarettes serve as a starter product for many youths and can provide a gateway to regular tobacco use. â€¢Use of menthol cigarettes is on the rise. While the overall smoking rate has decreased in the last decade, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that between 2004 and 2008, the rate of menthol cigarette use steadily increased, especially among young smokers. â€¢Menthol cigarettes are a gateway to regular tobacco use. Considerable research indicates that newer smokers favor menthol cigarettes at substantially higher levels than established smokers. Research further shows that a significant number of smokers eventually transition from menthol products to regular tobacco.â€¢Vulnerable youth populations are impacted in larger numbers. Menthol cigarettes have been found to have a disparate impact on youth in vulnerable populations, such as women, racial minorities, the LGBTQ community and people of low socioeconomic status. â€¢Menthol cigarettes are just as dangerous as regular cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes are not safer to smoke than regular cigarettes. Numerous studies have explored health dangers unique to menthol cigarettes.We appreciate your consideration of our comments. The evidence of the toll of menthol tobacco products is clear. We urge the FDA to act quickly to end this cycle of addiction by requiring tobacco companies to remove menthol as a flavoring in tobacco products. Sincerely, Joel J.

It is relevant to your considerations because it updates a presentation I made at a previous TPSAC meeting. It shows again, with more recent data, that among people who smoke, young people are the most likely to smoke mentholated cigarettes. This is true even after controlling for demographics, including household income. In addition, trends in the prevalence of smoking mentholated and non-mentholated cigarettes indicate differences in slopes in each of the age groups we studied (i.e., 12-17 years, 18-25 years, and 26+ years). Progress in reducing prevalence is occurring only in the reduction of non-menthol cigarette smoking. Menthol cigarette smoking prevalence increased among people who were 18-25 years old during the study period (2004 - 2010) and remained flat among those who were 12-17 years old and among people 26 years of age and older. In all three age groups, the prevalence of smoking non-mentholated cigarettes declined. These data indicate that the cigarette industry is holding on to the menthol market better than it is the non-menthol cigarette market. I believe very strongly that banning menthol would facilitate quitting and prevent initiation to a considerable extent and thus promote the public's health. I strongly urge FDA to ban all menthol from cigarettes and any other tobacco products under its jurisdiction.

Among current middle school smokers who are white, 39 percent smoke menthol cigarettes. Of high school students who are current smokers, 63 percent of African American, 50 percent of Hispanic and 49 percent of white high school students smoke menthol cigarettes.

With 32 sites spread across Alameda, Contra Costa and Solano Counties, La ClÃ­nica provides a comprehensive array of community-based primary health care services to a diverse patient population, the vast majority of whom are low-income, uninsured people of color. Through community health initiatives, La ClÃ­nica promotes smoke-free communities to decrease the risks of chronic disease and reduced life expectancy as a result of tobacco use and second-hand smoke. La ClÃ­nica works in partnership with the Alameda County Tobacco Control Coalition, an alliance of agencies, organizations and individuals that advocates for the prevention, reduction and control of tobacco use in Alameda County, California. In conjunction, La ClÃ­nica joins Alameda County and the City of Oakland in supporting the FDA banning menthol in cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) was an important step forward in regulating tobacco products. However, the law did not extend regulation to menthol in cigarettes, which masks the harshness of tobacco and entices new users to smoke, according to the U.S. Surgeon General. Since the TCA was passed, the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee issued a report underscoring the dangers of menthol in cigarettes, concluding that: â€œremoval of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.â€La ClÃ­nica urges the FDA to follow this advice and take action to: â€¢Prohibit menthol as an additive at any level. â€¢Forbid menthol in all tobacco products, not just cigarettes. â€¢Bar menthol analogs and substitutes in tobacco products to ensure that the FDAâ€™s action on menthol is not undermined by alternative products. â€¢Promote culturally appropriate cessation services to maximize the opportunity for menthol smokers to quit rather than to transition to a new tobacco product. La ClÃ­nica observes first-hand how tobacco use disproportionately impacts the health of vulnerable populations, including young people, African-Americans and other people of color. As documented by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (2009), nearly 83% of African-American smokers use menthol cigarettes, compared with 24% of White smokers. Prohibiting menthol as a characterizing flavor in tobacco products could prevent as many as 600,000 smoking-related premature deaths by 2050, a third of whom would be African-American. Prohibiting menthol in cigarettes is perhaps the single most powerful measure readily available to the FDA to improve Americaâ€™s health.

Menthol is an anesthetic which numbs the mouth and throat and allows people to more comfortably inhale the burning acrid toxic smoke from cigarettes. The mint flavor also covers up the unappealing flavor of natural tobacco. Menthol is also used in other tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco, to make ingestion more palatable; this encourages use, and eventually, addiction to nicotine.Menthol disproportionally affects young and disadvantaged populations. Teenagers in particular are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes, and when they do, they are more likely to become regular smokers. Menthol cigarettes are also used more frequently in socio-economically disadvantaged populations, and cigarettes containing menthol are associated with a decreased cessation success. African-Americans use menthol cigarettes more often than those of other races/ethnicities, and, in fact, according to a recent article in the American Journal of Public Health (Winickoff, 2011), African-Americans overwhelmingly support a ban on menthol in cigarettes. Tobacco companies are encouraging their constituents to argue that banning menthol would cost states financially in cigarette tax revenue. As a group whose mission relies on state tobacco tax dollars to fund the programs that we review, we would gladly accept a smaller pool of funds if that meant fewer smokers in Colorado, and a healthier public. In addition, the cost of lower tax revenue and increased enforcement will most likely be offset by the savings to the state in healthcare and other tobacco-related costs.Banning menthol in tobacco products will help us by:-Reducing adolescent smoking initiation-Decreasing smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations-Increasing the rate of smoking cessation among African-Americans-Reducing the overall smoking rate in the State of Colorado-Reducing tobacco-related death and disease for all ColoradansPlease take this opportunity to provide strong leadership in the regulation of tobacco products by banning menthol in all tobacco products.Sincerely,Karen Wilson, MD, MPHChildrenâ€™s Hospital ColoradoStatewide Tobacco Control NonprofitReview Committee ChairPamela Talley, MDWardenburg Health Center at CUFamily Physician AssociationReview Committee Vice-ChairJoseph Craig, MDColorado Permanente Medical GroupStatewide Physician AssociationReview Committee MemberKathy James, PhD, MSCEColorado School of Public HealthUniversity of Colorado/EvaluationReview Committee MemberKathleen Patrick, RN, MAColorado Department of EducationReview Committee MemberJennifer LudwigEagle County Public HealthLocal Public Health AgenciesReview Committee MemberDaniel Kortsch, MDDenver Health and HospitalsDisadvantaged PopulationsReview Committee MemberDave YoungState House of RepresentativesReview Committee Member",anesthetic,Positive,Positive,Positive
FDA-2013-N-0521,FDA-2013-N-0521-0469,"In accordance with the FDAâ€™s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) report in 2011 and the FDAâ€™s most recent scientific evaluation menthol in cigarettes published in 2013, as well as the Citizens Petition, we urge the FDA to take the following immediate steps:1)Add menthol to the list of chemicals and compounds identified by the FDA as harmful constituents in tobacco products. The scientific evidence in the TPSAC report on menthol indicated that menthol in cigarettes increases the risk for smoking initiation, transition to regular smoking, nicotine dependence, and quitting difficulty. It is important for the FDA to modify and broaden its definition of harmful and potentially harmful products to include these harms, since this specific continuum caused by menthol, leads to adverse health effects.2)Consistent with section 206 of the FSPTCA, require that any amount of menthol in natural or synthetic form, menthol analogs, and any constituent that â€œmimicsâ€ the sensory effects and attributes of menthol (e.g. smell, taste, flavor, cooling/tingling effects, anesthetic, analgesic, reduction in tobacco irritation), be disclosed and listed on the label of tobacco products. 3)Consistent with section 201, require that along with the 9 warning label messages, that labels also state that, â€œmenthol cigarettes increase risk for starting cigarette smokingâ€; â€œmenthol cigarettes are addictiveâ€; â€œmenthol cigarettes cause quitting difficultyâ€. These messages or versions of these messages are based on the scientific evidence in the TPSAC and FDA menthol reports, and will likely help to reduce any â€œrisk perceptionsâ€ that suggest that menthol is less harmful.4)Consistent with section 910, that any new tobacco or nicotine product introduced into the market be required to demonstrate that menthol or additives and constituents that â€œmimicâ€ mentholâ€™s sensory effects in that product do not cause any additional harm than the product introduced without menthol. â€œHarmâ€ is defined under #1. 5)We urge that the FDA conduct more research on any additives or constituents that mimic the sensory effects of menthol. 6)Finally, the FDA should move toward establishing as a product standard, zero levels of any additive, constituent, artificial or natural flavor that mimic the sensory effects of menthol in any tobacco or nicotine products to ensure that the FDAâ€™s action on menthol is not undermined. The prohibition should include the entire cigarette/tobacco product and any packaging related to the cigarette/tobacco product. The product standard established by FDA should be â€œzeroâ€ levels in order to protect the publicâ€™s health, including the health of youth, minorities, and other vulnerable populations who suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases. In 2011, TPSAC stated that â€œmenthol is not just a flavored additive and the menthol cigarettes should be removed from the public health market.â€ The FSPTCA states that, â€œImmediately upon the establishment of the TPSCA under section 917(a), the Secretary shall refer to the Committee for report and recommendation, under section 917(c)(4), the issue of the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health, including such use among children, African-Americans, Hispanics, and other racial and ethnic minorities. In its review, the TPSCA shall address the considerations listed in subsections (a)(3)(B)(i) and (b).â€ Thus, the examination of â€œpopulation net impactâ€ related to menthol is inclusive mentholâ€™s effects on children, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Hawaiians, Other Pacific Islanders, Asian Americans and all the ethnic groups that comprise this aggregate category, and American Indians and Alaska Natives people of our nation. â€œMinoritiesâ€™â€ as an aggregate group now comprise about 37% of the U.S.; by 2043, the U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority nation; and by 2060, the U.S. Census projects that 57% of the population will be â€œminoritiesâ€ (1). The menthol cigarette burden is disproportionately greater among disaggregate and the collective â€œminorityâ€ group as compared to Whites (2). Thus, we urge that FDAâ€™s thinking around the impact that regulatory policies have on populations consider policy effects on â€œminoritiesâ€, and in the absence of the policies, the increased potential burden that menthol can have on the growing population of â€œminoritiesâ€.

Public Health â€“ Seattle & King County, serving 1.9 million residents, supports a ban on menthol in cigarettes and all other tobacco products. We stongly recommend that a timeline to implement a ban include communication strategies and cessation resources that are appropriate for populations with high use of menthol.PHSKC addresses tobacco prevention as an equity initiative, focusing its attention and resources on the populations with the highest use. While tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable death in King County, the risk of tobacco use is not equitableâ€”with extreme disparities by race/ethnicity. While the overall smoking rate in King County is 14%, African Americans smoke at a rate of 23%. The association between income and smoking does not account for the difference. When viewed across income levels, a racial disparity persists among households with higher incomes (>$50,000). In this group, African Americans (16%) smoke significantly more than their White counterparts (8%). The racial gap in tobacco use has grown since 2000.It is important to note that part of this gap is due to different outcomes with cessation attempts. While more African Americans intend to quit than Whites in King County (and at least as many attempt to do so), the success rate is significantly lower among African Americans. Forty-six percent of African Americans in King County who were smokers have quit, compared to 67% of Whites. The FDA has said that use of menthol cigarettes may make quitting difficult. We know that King County, like the rest of the country, has a disproportionate share of African American smokers who use menthol products. Removing menthol from tobacco products would likely help more African American tobacco users quit.The FDA has also reported that menthol is likely associated with increased initiation and increased progression to regular smoking. Most adult smokers began smoking as youth. The influences on youth that contribute to regular smoking in adulthood are critical to identify and abate. Among King County youth who report smoking, youth of color (44%) are more likely to have smoked menthol cigarettes than White youth (33%). It is likely that menthol use contributes to more youth of color becoming adult smokers in King County. From both a health equity and a health protection perspective, banning menthol in cigarettes and other tobacco products is a critical step toward decreasing tobacco use and increasing years of healthy lives lived.Sincerely, David Fleming, MDDirector and Health Officer",critical step,Positive,Positive,Positive

I tried 9 times with traditional NRT products and failed. Vaping is the most successful quit smoking aid in the history of the world, and has helped tens of millions of people quit, and stay smoke free. The PMTA process has some good values. We want to make sure that vaping flavors/products are safe, and made in clean environments, which a great number of them are already. The worst thing about the PMTA process is the price. Charging companies possibly millions of dollars for the process is only affordable by the wealthiest companies in this country, which are Big Tobacco companies, and not small mom and pop vaping businesses. This will force over 90% of vapor companies to go bankrupt, because only the wealthiest companies will survive. Also, the constant changing rules for the PMTA is problematic as well. How can companies know they are following the right rules, when they have changed several times already. Or, a company could be half way through the process, and the FDA will change the rules again on a whim, and that company will be disqualified, and broke now because of the outrageous price.

It has already been proven that the nicotine products that are available to buy in reputable vape shops are NOT the cause of these lung illnesses and deaths that are occurring now. The cause is that black market drug dealers are putting vitamin E acetate in their products. The vitamin E acetate is an oil that cannot be broken down in the lungs. The regulated nicotine ejuice that's you purchase from reputable vape shops are water soluble.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0691,"The PMTA process has been overly burdensome for companies to be compliant. The process could be streamlined just like the craft beer industry by having a list of approved ingredients to include flavor concentration companies, nicotine manufactures and PG/VG manufactures as well as ratios that can be used to make e-liquids. When companies use the pre-approved ingredients they should be auto approved for US sale. 95% of e-liquid manufacture in the US uses the same companies for ingredients in all their formulas, it seems like a waste of time and money to have to submit a new application for every nicotine and flavor variation they make. I understand that the process is to protect the consumer, but it seems that the application process is designed to not allow almost all the market to not be able to apply. When we limit the market we encourage a monopoly and bad players with deep pockets to dominate the market. We need a streamlined process that will allow small manufactures the ability to apply and receive approval to sell on the open market to complete with the tobacco companies This will help drive down prices and improve innovation of new technology at the same time. Minor modification to existing products should not be hindered by a new application just to make improvements. The FDA should be open to new technology and improvements that can make products safer or easier to use instead of freezing the market. This growing industry has the ability to save Millions of lives and Trillions of dollars in health care during our lifetime. The Federal government needs to embrace the advancements that industry can provide and the Billions in annual sales.I believe that the e-liquids need to be manufactured in a certified clean lab to protect the consumer. It will allow the FDA to assure the public that these products are made in the same standards that food manufactures use. We do not want to have small retail stores making e-liquids on counters with no safety standards for safe manufacturing of liquids that will be inhaled. If a company does not have a certified clean laboratory to make liquids in, they should not be allowed to manufacture products for the safety of the consumers.When it comes to nicotine levels allowed for sale in the US I truly believe that there needs to be a nicotine cap of about 20-30mg. This level will allow consumers that have a high nicotine addiction the ability to use vapor products to move away from combustible tobacco and to start to lower their nicotine levels in a rapid timeframe. Some heavy users that have been smoking 2-3 packs a day for many years will need to have a higher nicotine level than the average user. We must also think of them when we determine nicotine cap limits. Flavors are very crucial for a consumer to disassociate from the taste of combustible tobacco. The flavors that are available to the consumer makes the transition easier and keep them from relapsing back to combustible tobacco. Regulating the packaging and subsequently the marketing will be key to not appealing to the youth. It can taste like a candy, but does not have to have candy in the name. Restricting advertising on TV, Print and limiting social media marketing can remove the images from youth viewing. Only allow the sale of flavored nicotine in dedicated adult only shops (similarly to alcohol) along with higher fines for underage sales will dramatically reduce youth access. Its time to also enforce the laws that exist on Minor in Possession of Tobacco laws that are already in place. The fines should also be increased for possession as well.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0705,"With the current PMTA requirements small business has little chance of completing a PMTA for even a single flavor. Estimates for doing only the required laboratory tests place the cost at ridiculously unaffordable. Products are individualized by strength and bottle size, rather treating them by recipe or even flavor, would reduce costs due to the fact that it is basically the same product A small line of E-Liquid generally has roughly 25 recipes. This makes their cost out of reach and puts many out of business to get only part of testing done. Many of these products have been on the market for years without health issues to the public. This is not attainable by 99 percent of an industry that is made up of small business. Products that have been on the market and have successfully registered and listed ingredients have a long-standing history of compliance with the FDA and created a trusted relationship with consumers. Unless the process is changed most companies will not reach the end of the PMTA process. This would be a major blow for harm reduction. It's time to find solutions for small business owners that put their hard work and hearts into harm reduction. For public health we must avoid an unregulated black market and we must achieve traceability in the vapor industry so any issues can be tracked with both speed and accuracy. This will benefit the industry, the public and the FDA.Automation that has been utilized in the private sector for at least 10 years. Rapid data comparison is vital in any situation where public health is a factor and simply will not happen if you are relying on people no matter how skilled to do that job. Most of the same ingredients that are used in E-Liquid have been used for years with no public health events. We should be utilizing approved ingredients like the food industry. The response time is quick and decisive due to utilizing this model and it has been shown many times to provide consumer protection.As stated by the IOWA Attorney General The current model requires companies to establish the same basic facts repeatedly. Under the current approach, FDA's highly trained staff will parse millions of pages of routine and repetitive documentation, and its assessments will be driven by the adequacy of paperwork rather than underlying product safety. https://www.iowaattorneygeneral.gov/media/cms/PMTA_letter__190724__headed_45164DED1A0BA.pdfThere should be a focus group of industry experts created to have regular meetings with the FDA to streamline and facilitate a successful PMTA process. No task is successful unless the process is fully understood by those making the rules. Base ingredient testing is simply not how the PMTA process is written and would be easier and less for the FDA to scrutinize over mountains of recipe submissions The industry has a 10-year track record of successfully transitioning smokers to harm reduction as former FDA Administrator Dr Gottlieb stated. In my opinion if we work together, we can find a way to keep these small businesses transitioning smokers and creating traceability in the industry so should an event occur there is a rapid response to any issue, therefore ensuring public safety. Not working together will create an unregulated market that is not safe for anyone. We look forward to working with the FDA to find resolutions for the industry.I would like to emphasize that flavored eliquid has been in the markets for over 10 years without public health issues. Open system eliquid has never marketed to youth and there was never a youth problem until pod systems were developed. I can attest that my company, as many others, have registered all flavors and ingredients with the FDA and have been abiding by the proposed guidance since inception. I am a small manufacturer. I don't know if I can afford the PMTA requirements as they stand today. I believe labs are price gouging and itemizing everything they process.

Now I get my ejuice from a small business that just informed us that their closing their doors!! They could weather the storm till May but due to all the fda regs and governors trying to ban flavored ejuice sales have declined and it's not viable or mentally healthy for the owner to stay open till then. And if he did the cost alone for 1 flavor is horenedous!!! Why would yall make the pmta so expensive to file? The only companies that could afford it my opinion would be big tobacco. It's also going to shut the shop that I work at down most likely because we make our own house flavored ejuice and that's probably 90% if not more of theOur business intake. So then we would only have ejuice from who know who to sell and I could only imagine by then what a bottle of ejuice would cost the consumer.

The current PMTA process is so expensive and time consuming that only the largest companies will be able to afford it.

Many users of vapor products support small businesses and liquid makers that cannot afford the PMTA process, and those companies would shut down. Losing jobs and revenue for their states.Instead please make the process cost less and be more accessible to smaller manufacturers and companies, as these are the people that have driven the industry and support it the most. Asking liquid makers for $100,000 per SKU is too much to afford, and the 6mo-1yr waiting period coupled with this ensures all smaller companies will shut down and only Big Tobacco products (like JUUL) will take over the market.

The effects of nicotine are addictive, and serious health illnesses are the result of tobacco's other chemicals that are used. Bronchitis, lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and strokes are the result of smoking. Nicotine is harmful and is poisonous, and there is a possibility of overdose (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2019). I am a registered nurse, and last week, I cared for a 19-year-old female that had vaped for only two years, and her lungs are completely impaired. This patient will now be required to see a pulmonologist for the rest of her life. I feel the general public has every right to know exactly what substances they are inhaling into their bodies. The public should also know the potential health risks they are taking when they smoke any form of tobacco, nicotine, or addictive substances into their lungs. The FDA is in place to protect the public from harm, and it has already been proven that tobacco and nicotine are addictive and harmful. If there are changes of any kind to current tobacco or nicotine products, the users of these products have every right to know what was changed. Therefore, I am for the requirements for premarket tobacco product application (PMTAs), which would require the manufacturers to keep records showing that the tobacco products are being legally sold.

Unlike other commitments, I will give you a solution on how to change it for all involved.1) Do not allow sales outside of a specialist business.2) Age verification is a must.3) Require names of final liquid to be ambiguities to their flavor to not entice minors.4) Required handling license like food handler's license and required yearly recertification that requires education on proper handling, storage, and manufacturing of products for safety and quality.5) A standard ingredients list that all must abide by as a approval standard I.e. nicotine, PG, VG, and FDA approved food flavors and enhancers. Since companies already have to submit a list, you can make one that assures purity and quality for the safety of the public. This would be no different than many household chemicals that are used every day that would require warnings. Plus remove items that don't really contain tobacco i.e. batteries.6) Only new ingredients that diverge from the standard ingredient list should go through a pre-market analysis.7) Allow the market to develop higher quality hardware to reduce or eliminate hazzards. i.e. exploding batteries. Hardware must go through a testing body independent of government and business owners to prove safety of hardware. This would be like testing any electric device for safety. I.e. smart phones, cars, food, ...8) Each item must carry a seal of approval from FDA and/or other approval party. i.e tax stamp.The above is no different than what most businesses have to do today.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0743,"I welcome the proposed rule that would systematize procedures the FDA would follow when evaluating PMTAs. I highlight here the Reporting Requirements (Proposed 1114.41) under Postmarket Requirements which would put in place an infrastructure that would allow for regular monitoring of sociodemographic changes of tobacco product users. The proposed rule would require reporting on demographic characteristics of product purchasers including age, gender, and tobacco use status by manufacturers at least once a year. Importantly, the rule would also require information on all data sources used to target advertising to specific adult audiences by age groups including young adults. Such requirements set on manufacturers is critical in stopping the explosion of e-cigarette use among youth and young adults, including many who never used tobacco in their lives. For instance, the increase in the prevalence of nicotine vaping among high school students from just 2017 to 2018 was the largest prevalence increase ever recorded by the Monitoring the Future Study in 44 years.[1] While JUUL has contributed significantly to such rise by targeting youth and young adults, it will not be long before the next JUUL enters the market and poses new challenges to public health authorities. Putting robust systems in place for monitoring and surveillance, as this rule proposes, will be a long-overdue step in the right direction. S M Iftekhar Uddin, MBBS, MSPH [1] Miech et al. 2019.

Also work at a vape shop and have been vaping since 2011 on and off but got off the cigarettes in 2016. Smoking for 26yrs and I am 44yrs old. If it wasnt for flavored ejuices it probably would have never worked. I only use 3mg of nicotine and the whole hand to mouth, flavors and nicotine (not 6000 carcinogens like combustible cigarettes) is what helped me quit. Banning flavors will decimate 12,000,000+ adult vapers lives!! We do care about the kids and their are solutions not prohibition that would work If put I to place. Such as raise the age to 21, get rid of pod systems like juul and others, get rid of saltnic( no need for that high of nicotine level unless used in a proper device with smaller vapor to compensate for the high nicotine. Get any vape products out of convenience stores, Walgreens, Cvs, ect. These people will sell to minors and do not have a clue what their selling. Specialized vape shops should be one of two places to get such products.We card and deny access into store if your not of legal age no exceptions. The other is online sales, keep them for those on rural areas with no access to a vape shop and implement an age verification system that correlates with a picture of there face and state identification. Just so there parents or friend doing a straw purchase. Hold his accountable if a device is found on them, not only in school but anywhere. Parents need to be held accountable!! Fines, suspension, expulsion, and parents ultimately being fined as well. But about the pmta deadline by May 2020 is way to early for the deadline to apply. Also the cost to apply one flavor as I understand it is an obnoxious amount of money!! Trump want businesses and there are over 150,000 businesses not including over 100,000 jobs that people depend on. A suggestion is to classify it like we do with our taxes, different tiers due to what the shop or distro makes in a yr on average. The only one who could possibly afford this is big tobacco!! I feel that the pmta was setup like that to rid itself of these small businesses that make ejuice and cant afford to apply for one flavor and If they could theres not a guarantee that it even gets approved. Just know we vape we vote. And flavors have saves lives. I tried a tobacco flavor and it about made me vomit!!

Open vapor is less harmful, and I think the industry has done decent self regulating for the last 10 years considering there haven't been any mass outbreaks of tainted nicotine products.

Now that's been confirmed by the CDC and either backed up or at least reported on by the FDA.

I fought with tobacco addiction for 20 years and found vaping to be the best source to quit smoking over 5 years ago and have not looked back. I use an open tank system and use a fruit flavored nicotine level of 3mg eliquid that I can refill when empty. The flavored eliquid I have always used has 4 ingredients and is on file with your agency. It contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine, and flavoring(blue raspberry). Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals including 43 known cancer causing carcinogens. I used to get sick on a regular basis, but illness has been virtually non existent since I switched to vaping.Most eliquid sold in BM stores across the US has a nicotine level of less than 20mg. That is less than the nicotine patch, yet vaping is classified as a tobacco product and the patch is not. I heard it will cost manufactures upwards of $500k per sku for you to even consider authorizing the use of their products. That is an absurd amount of money when the product has already been tested to be safer than smoking across the country and the world. The eliquid I use comes in 3 nicotine levels (0mg, 3mg, 6mg), and just that one flavor alone would cost $1.5M for the FDA to even look at it. 0mg doesn't even contain nicotine. The open tank system I use has 6 parts to it (mod, batteries, tank, drip tip, coil, & glass). None of those contain nicotine until I add an eliquid that contains nicotine. Is that another $3M for you to look at it? These outrageous fees will kill this industry and provide an unregulated black market which we are already seeing. I want quality in my nicotine eliquid, unlike what we are seeing with the lethal oils put into THC carts.Vaping has been a life saver for me as well as millions of others in the US.

Cigarette companies entered into the PMTA with decades of profit, a hundred years of sales and history, and you're expecting mom and pop, small businesses to meet the same burden. You wouldn't expect a bicycle to meet the same safety standards as a sports car. The PMTA will destroy 99% of the businesses in this space and hand a fledgling industry over to big tobacco, the only ones with the money to pay to play. Vaping is helping convert smokers to a safer, better alternative every day, taking that option from Americans while continuing to offer traditional cigarettes would be an affront to public health and public service. Flavors play a vital role in providing a preferable experience for smokers from the smell and taste of cigarettes. Studies have shown that vaping is markedly more successful at keeping smokers away from cigarettes than any OTC or prescription option, attacking that success only speaks to corruption and greed.",money,Negative,Negative,Negative

Majestic and reputable as the FDA currently feels they are I would assume that the proper information would be coming out of your guys's organization. If you really feel that there is such an issue with underage vaping a couple of awesome tips to help with that would be:1. Require all cities to have a legitimate vape shop that sells Vapor Products and stop allowing mixed retail locations to sell these products. 2. Require all legitimate vape shops to scan IDs and then provide scan reports3. Raise the age for all tobacco products not just vaping to 214. Restrict advertising on social media, and TVSome adverse effects of what you guys are doing include the fact that people are moving back toward making their Ejuice at home where you cannot check or test.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0791,"I was a smoker for 5 years before I switched to vaping. I had been smoking 3 almost 4 packs of cigarettes a day since I was 16 years old. Both of my parents were also heavy smokers. However, the day that I discovered vaping changed my life. I was able to quit smoking in a single day because of how much I enjoyed the flavors. I was able to quit using a vanilla custard flavor. I have not touched a single cigarette since. My parents saw how well it worked for me and they were both able to quit smoking; my mom using a chocolate mint flavor and my dad using a strawberry cookie flavor. They too have not and have no desire to smoke ever again. I had tried many avenues to quit but nothing was ever successful. I truly feel that I would still be smoking if not for vaping. Getting rid of flavors would be detrimental, both to businesses and consumers. The flavored vape products are the reason most adults were able to quit smoking. Banning flavors would most likely push more people back into smoking and discourage others from quitting in the first place. Small locally owned vape shops also heavily rely on the sales of liquids to stay in business. Without the flavored liquids, many will be forced to close their doors. Many will lose their livelihood and what they are passionate about. Please reconsider the flavor ban. It will do nothing but cause harm.",flavour,Negative,Negative,Negative

I have currently already stepped down from the well known juul device to a customizable ejuice device. I easily cut my nicotine consumption in half. I plan to step down again in January. Based on research and practicao learning from fellow ex-smokers, I anticipate breaking my addiction by beginning of 2021. I am very committed to this date and worry that excessive regulation and restrictions of the PMTA may present an obstacle to my personal goals. I prefer to deal with my small independent vape business who have knowledge and passion about the latest products, options and ejuice.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0795,"The PMTA process for nicotine e-liquid used in open style ENDS products presents itself as an repetitive requirement that all manufacturers submit the same request/documents for approval, considering there is an entire e-liquid manufacturing industry that uses the same ingredients, I propose the FDA work towards a more streamlined and economical process for the nicotine e-liquid industry to collectively submit standards for nicotine e-liquid.With the current PMTA requirements small business has little chance of completing a PMTA for even a single flavor. Estimates for doing only the required laboratory tests place the cost at 4 million dollars per sku. Also, the way products are defined by the FDA everyone who registered found that a single recipe that is sold in 5 nicotine strengths including zero, and in 5 different bottle sizes becomes 25 different products. A small line of E-Liquid generally has roughly 25 recipes. This makes their cost 100,000,000 dollars to get only the chemical testing done. Many of these products have been on the market for over 10 years. This is not attainable by 99 percent of an industry that is made up of small business. Products that have been on the market and have successfully registered and listed ingredients have a long-standing history of compliance with the FDA and created a trusted relationship with consumers. It's easy to see that unless the process is changed most companies will not reach the end of the PMTA process. We can utilize both technology and master files to better streamline the process for small business. For public health we must avoid an unregulated black market vapers will not go back to combustibles they will just make their own e-liquid. WE must achieve traceability in the vapor industry so any issues can be tracked with both speed and accuracy. This will also help streamline the PMTA process and remove much of the tedious and repetitive manual requirements. This will benefit the industry, the public and the FDA. Data standardization is key to implementing any technology solution. During meetings with the FDA to simplify ingredients registration for small businesses concern over lack of data standardization was expressed many times. Despite objections the data that was collected was never put in a standardized format that would be usable in any type of database. Therefore, to my knowledge, the FDA is not able to search those registrations with any automated process. This kind of automation has been utilized in the private sector for at least 10 years. Rapid data comparison is vital in any situation where public health is a factor and simply will not happen if you are relying on people no matter how skilled to do that job. Most of the same ingredients that are used in E-Liquid have been used for years with no public health events. As an industry we could utilize master files however with the number of flavor combinations the tests would need to be done on base ingredients alone and not recipes, even a large industry group would be unable to establish that kind of master file. However, base ingredient testing is simply not how the PMTA process is written. Due to the significant costs simply to apply, only the big tobacco companies would have the capital to complete the entire PMTA process. There are over 14,000 small businesses and over 150,000 jobs that will be lost if the PMTA requirements are not adjusted to provide a level playing field. This will have a huge economic impact in a devastating way, and will also create a prohibition of flavored vaping products which have helped more than 13 million Americans give up combustible cigarettes. Adults need a range of flavors to continue the dissociation of smoking and continue vaping. Only roughly 5% of adults use tobacco flavored e-liquid. These PMTA requirements will single handedly wipe out over 14,000 small businesses, while providing absolutely no benefit to the public health. These open system vapor products have shown themselves to be the most valuable smoking cessation tool to date. Given their success at lowering the adult smoking rate, it would be irresponsible and unethical to remove them from the market. The same institution (The Royal College of Physicians) that told the Surgeon General that cigarettes were deadly many years ago is now telling us that vaping is 95% less harmful than combustible cigarettes. Why are we not listening again?The PMTA shouldn't be a hurdle that closes thousands of businesses across the country and hands vaping over to big tobacco due to these astronomical fees. 480,000 smokers are dying every year in America and the PMTA costs and hurdles will prevent vaping from prospering and having the potential to save those lives from combustible tobacco.",economical,Negative,Negative,Negative

Having converted over 5000 smokers to vaping over the last 6.5 years, i can personally attest to the fact that flavored vapor products are CRITICAL in assisting adult smokers to convert to vapor products. The current PMTA process needs to be repealed and overhauled to allow the small businesses that grew this industry a chance to survive and continue serving their consumers. Even using the FDA's own estimate of $100,000 per sku to submit a PMTA, as a small business owner i would be unable to submit even a single sku. Furthermore, these FDA cost estimates are ridiculous. Recent submissions by big tobacco players and prior submissions by Sweedish Match puts the costs for submitting a single product somewhere northward of $10,000,000 per sku. This is TOTALLY unattainable by small businesses who are at the core of this industry. Implementing the PMTA process as it currently exists would not only result in the closing of my 4 stores and the loss of jobs for my 10 employees, but also the closing of 13000 other small 'mom and pop' shops and an additional 150,000 jobs lost. I suggest you follow a path more similar to the EU and their TPD regulations that permits testing to show a products safety by conducting test on the constituent ingredients and finished product. This would offer a more reasonable chance for small businesses to survive. If the PMTA process goes through as it currently exists, only the 'Big Tobacco' players would remain in the vapor space with no vested interest in whether or not consumers use harm reduced vapor products or continue to buy their cigarettes which kill 480,000 people annually in the US.

The key was the flavors I was able to choose from. Vanilla cheesecake keeps me from going back to cigarettes and has prolonged my life.

That being said, subjecting American e-liquid manufacturers to the extensive and expensive PMTA process is going to effectively kill off hundreds of small businesses. Many of these companies do not have the ability or the finances to meet these requirements.I think there is a compromise that can be found that will serve to regulate the industry to the standards the FDA wants to achieve without putting so many American business owners out of business. One thing that would drastically help is to classify the vaping industry separately from the tobacco industry. Vapor products, specifically e-liquids, contain vastly different ingredients than tobacco products. The only similar ingredient happens to be nicotine. Traditional tobacco companies can afford to go through the premarket tobacco product application process with very little issue. E-liquid companies often times offer several different flavors with varying levels of nicotine.If the FDA were to embrace vaping as an industry with reasonable and sound regulations and not fall into the same trap this country did in regards to tobacco control throughout the last several decades, I have no doubt that it would engender trust, appreciation, and an overall net positive to the citizens of this nation.",oversight ,Negative,Negative,Negative

Many nicotine vape shops have several e-liquid flavors that are made in house. Each of these flavors come in various nicotine strengths to aide customers with the step-down process of their nicotine level. To force small businesses to have to spend millions to seek approval is outrageous and cost-prohibitive. This will directly have an impact on millions of adult customers who use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to reduce the harm caused by combustible cigarettes. Combustible cigarettes kill 480,000 people every year according to the CDC. ENDS provides an alternative that, according to the Royal College of Physicians, is shown to be 95% safer vs. cigarettes. Measures such as the PMTA are damaging to the health and well-being of adult smokers who, if ENDS were eliminated, would go back to combustible cigarettes or seek alternatives such as the black-market to continue their efforts to remain tobacco-free.I am asking the FDA to use a light-touch regulatory process that does not hinder small businesses and allows adult consumers the ability to obtain ENDS and flavored liquids.

Flavors allow the adult smoker to disassociate from the taste and smell of tobacco combustible cigarettes making their efforts to quit far more successful. Youth access is something that none of us want. There are better, more effective ways of reducing youth use while maintaining adult access. Heavy regulation will have an opposite effect, drawing more people back to cigarettes or the more dangerous black-market. We can not allow criminals to invade a regulated and safe market and increase crime rates across the country.I strongly urge the FDA to reconsider the harsh and expensive requirements for the PMTA to allow small businesses the chance to have their products lawfully registered and safe for sale to adults.",Heavy regulation,Negative,Negative,Negative

This ensures accountability of Tobacco companies. In the past the lack of legally marking products has resulted in a large portion of individuals becoming addicted to tobacco. In the past, cigarettes were marketed as cool and healthy, doctors even used to prescribe them to patients when cigarettes first came out. The long-term effects of cigarettes were unknown at the time which is what made them so popular. Eventually as time progressed, we became aware of the long-term effects and tobacco companies were then legally obligated to start marking their products appropriately. Now it seems like history is repeating itself with the Juul and other vape products. Juul took over the market by a storm due to the sleek design of the product and the unknowing of the long-term effects. Juul has only been around a couple of years but we are now discovering more and more cases of health issues derived from Juul and it seems like the effects are much worse because it happens so rapidly from the start of use. Many young people that Juul are having lung-collapse and other health issues and this worries me because many of my friends are very addicted to Juul. The long-term Juul health effects are likely to be much worse than the long-term effects from cigarettes. A full pod is equal to a full pack of cigarettes and with the Juul being a vape it is much easier to smoke it all day every day because you can smoke it indoors with no smell like the common cigarette delivers. The Juul is designed for the younger generation and peer pressure has enabled younger people to start buying them which leads to the addiction of the product. The many flavors one can get and the ability to smoke them indoors has been a prevalent factor in the popularity and addiction of the product.

If the government allows us to use a cigarettes which are proven to kill 480,000 people per year then why is it an issue to use a product that has NEVER KILLED ANYONE?!The people who have gotten ill and some that died, did NOT die from vaping e-liquid. This has been proven. As far as the 'youth vaping epidemic' goes, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to smoke, drink alcohol or vape! The youth will experiment with anything because they all want to get into whatever their told not to touch. Why isn't alcohol being banned? Many of the youth have died from alcohol overdose and drinking & driving accidents yet no word ever on banning alcohol. The same goes for cigarettes but that's off limits because of all the money each state gets from the tobacco companies through the master settlement agreement. So now that the government sees that a product is actually working to get millions of adults to quit smoking you want to use the excuse of the youth epidemic to increase you're MSA money! Before ever considering banning a product you need to deal with these incorrigible kids who are BREAKING THE LAW! They should be fined each time they are caught vaping. Weather it is juul pods or thc carts. Also they should have their driver's license suspended for 30,60,90 days depending on the amount of offenses. As far as the parents, they need to take away the one thing a kid can't live without... their cell phones! My suggestions will work to get these kids to stop because if they're given consequences that are very strict & enforced that's the only way they will understand we mean business. Otherwise you will have millions of kids thinking they are above the law and will soon turn into criminals, drug addicts and drug dealers! I'm not going to suffer for something a kid is doing by breaking the law. If a ban goes into effect and my flavors will be removed I will be forced to do exactly what the kids are doing and that is buying from the black market and I will also make my eliquid at home. The vape community knows how to DIY as many already make their own flavored eliquid because they can't afford high prices. We ALL have 1 goal and that is to STOP SMOKING and refuse to go back to cigarettes and giving our blood money to the government! I'm sick over all these lies and corruption that I've witnesses ever since I began to advocate for my and all the other vaper and smokers rights! I am extremely disappointed in the way the system is run. You people need to listen to the adult vapers and the truth instead of going by with the fake stats and listening to the kids lies.

Flavors haven't changed in 3 years because of these deeming regulations. EVALI is a recent illness. Therefore, registered e-liquid manufacturers that have sent you their ingredients have nothing to do with recent lung injuries. Furthermore, you have 15 years and millions of human trials to prove that these registered e-liquids are making smokers quit smoking and in the process healthier. Most pharmaceuticals are tested for less than a year and many still have deadly side effects. Compare the number of deaths due to Chantix to the number of deaths from vaping registered e-liquids (zero) and you will agree that no further testing is needed. Registration of ingredients is a value to the industry, however there has to be a cost exemption for these small vape shop pioneers who have families to feed. These are the Americans who started a business in order to make America a better place; to make Americans healthier; to wipe out cigarettes and lung disease and COPD. Because of a local vape shop, I quit smoking 7 years ago after 23 years of smoking. I never would have quit if I were required to get a prescription for e-liquid. I never would have quit if I hadn't found a flavor that I liked. I quit by using 24 mg of nicotine and was down to 12 mg within a few months. I currently use 3 mg nicotine. I don't think anyone really needs 50 mg of nicotine. Please let flavors continue to help people quit. Please look into capping nicotine levels to 24 so kids won't use them to get a nicotine high. Please follow the highly successful model of the Public Health England. England does not have a youth vaping problem and they do not have the lung injuries of the United States.

It was created long before nicotine vaping products were even invented.The completely different vaping products are magnitudes safer than regular combustible cigarettes and are sold in a completely different way. It is unfair to hold small businesses which make up the majority of the adult vaping market to the same measures meant to block billion dollar corporations. The current process is financially insurmountable for all eliquid manufacturers, device manufacturers that are predominantly small businesses as each flavor would have to have its own SEPARATE application multiplied by different nicotine strengths. That means a small shop that creates only 30 flavors would have to submit 150 separate applications. (30 flavors X 5 different nicotine strengths (0,3,6,12, and 18) = 150 separate PMTA applications. The company I normally order from currently sells approximately 400 flavors, so 400 x 5 would be 2000 separate applications.The ONLY businesses that will be able to comply with these draconian regulations are the large corporations, ie: the tobacco companies themselves. The only products left on the market will be the ones backed by the tobacco companies, including JUUL, which is owned at least partially by Altria.As nicotine vaping products are about 95% safer than combustible cigarettes it seems VERY unfair to have policies that favor the large tobacco companies as they are the only ones with the financial means to even attempt the PMTA process. The end result will be that the large tobacco companies will be the only ones to get any product on the market and at the same time decimates an industry that so far has been the ONLY real threat to deadly tobacco cigarettes. One possible solution would be to exempt the much safer nicotine vaping products from the rigorous and prohibitively expensive PMTA process provided that they are sold in adult restricted businesses similar to how alcohol products are handled.

(See Royal College of Physicians, England) The industry is concerned about youth using e-cigarettes and totally agree that they should not use the Ends Products, however, a Flavor ban generated through the PMTA process will only exacerbate the problem and leave the industry closed down with the exception of Altria, British American Tobacco and a small number of others. Nicotine Vaping has proven twice as effective as any NRT method out there (NEJM). And it does not have the side effects of Chantix and Wellbutrin.

Many people will agree that vaping, while not entirely risk free, is certainly far healthier than smoking cigarettes.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0968,"Smoking costs millions and millions of lives across the globe annually, and people suffer through their addiction to cigarette tobacco, pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco. They suffer hideously disabling and disfiguring diseases and even still, many smokers are stuck chained to the yoke of that addiction until the day they die, and sometimes they unwittingly take loved ones and even their pets with them through continuous exposure to second hand smoke and the residues it leaves behind for children to play on. It was a horrible, horrible thought to realize that anyone in close proximity to MY cigarette was being exposed to toxic waste.I discovered vaping after I had exhausted every other avenue that I could find in my efforts to quit smoking for good. This device that I have in my hand right now is what saved me from carrying on with that relentless cycle of failure that I had become so used to. It is the device itself and the flavored juices that I use with it which made that possible and made cigarettes obsolete. I can do things with my vape that I could never do with a cigarette, and because my device is so vastly superior to fire at the end of a stick which tastes like burn wood mixed with car exhaust when inhaled, quitting was actually quite enjoyable. I control the temperature of my vapor and the strength of the nicotine I inhale. I can decide if I want to feel the vapor in my throat, or not. I have moved down from 6mg nicotine, to 0 nicotine and 3mg if I feel I'd like some.Nothing soothed my irritated throat and lungs the way vape did when I first quit. It also soothed my nerves because while I did still had access to nicotine, I was also withdrawing from the many other alkaloids that these tobacco companies had incorporated into their products which enhanced the addicting effects of the nicotine. But cigarettes had finally met their match with this wonderful device because I simply woke up one day and realized that I hadn't smoked in quite some time and furthermore, I had no desire to whatsoever. Wow. Just wow.It gave me back the control that I had been denied for over three decades of my life, and I am no longer a slave to an outrageously priced killer bent on decimating my wallet while inflicting a very long and slow death sentence on me.But now I and thousands and perhaps millions of others are faced with these sweeping and draconian PMTA regulations and flavor bans because you want to take that control away, demolish the entire vaping industry and hand the wreckage of what's left over back to big tobacco so they they can reconstitute 'vaping' into a cigarette styled device filled with cigarette flavored liquid because they're addicts - they will have to take what we force-feed them.By doing this, you will be destroying the lives of all of those people who put their heart and souls into creating and developing and producing these devices and the juices that we buy. You are taking away my right to read the safety data sheets that many of these companies freely provide because they are well aware that a lot of us want to know exactly what we are buying and putting into our bodies. We have trust issues, you see.You are depriving people who have not yet made the switch the opportunity to do so, and you are trying to take the very thing that saved, not only my life, by my sense of self and self worth right out of my hands and the hands of everybody else who successfully QUIT their deadly addiction to toxic smoke, while telling us that what is good for us is to have a dubious fluid produced by even more dubious companies inserted into a cigarette like device that tastes like cigarettes. And let's face it, that will cause thousands of people to go back to the habit they thought they had given up for good -- or turn to a black market source in order to continue doing what they were doing before their supply was cut off.That would be an unbelievable tragedy and all the more tragic because an agency of the government is what would force them to do it.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-0986,"Please remember when dealing with ENDS, this industry was created by smokers, for smokers, to combat a big tobacco problem. It's also important to keep in mind that the youth vaping problem we are dealing with is created by one company, which is JUUL. Open systems are not attractive to our youth and regulating both sides (open vs. closed systems) isn't logical.The general format required for submitting PMTA's is too cumbersome and burdensome for 99.9% of the vapor industry stakeholders. Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gotlieb mentioned in an interview that it was approximately $100 MILLION dollars for IQOS to process their PMTA. No business, except for huge corporations can absorb this cost to allow them marketing authorization. This system is designed for massive big tobacco companies as well as massive big pharmaceutical companies. For some industries this may work, for the ENDS industry it does not. You are dealing with small businesses, which need to be treated differently due to the lack of revenue to comply. Although I'm sure FDA's intent wasn't to shut down all the small guys, that is exactly what you will be doing with these requirements for marketing authorization. By shutting down all the small guys you will be handing the industry over to big tobacco which will lead to more youth vaping.It is my belief that PMTA's should be scrapped, and product standards should be put into place. By putting product standards into place as well as good manufacturing practices you can have better control of the industry. Regulating the ENDS industry with similarly to the EU model will allow open systems to remain on the market and will allow the industry to continue to help smokers make the change to a tar free nicotine delivery method.There should also be a predicate date of 8/8/2016 for all products that were already marketed at that time. Having a predicate date of 2/15/2009 allows big tobacco combustible products to remain on the market when they kill over 1300+ people daily. If this is truly about public health, you would ban combustible products and allow the open vape industry marketing authorization until you can create a set of standards for the industry. Using regulation to ban alternative tar free nicotine delivery systems and allowing combustible products to remain on the market without having to go through the process is a bad decision for public health.

I am a small business owner in the retail space for vapor products only. I employ 7 young adults that rely on this business to finance college, mortgages and families. PMTA was designed to regulate tobacco products, I feel that this process was written to keep other tobacco companies from the market. It is very onerous and very expensive. The vapor industry is comprised of mostly small manufacturers that cannot afford this process. The only manufacturers that will afford this will be Large tobacco companies that will take over the industry due to this regulatory process.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-1004,"See attached file(s)There are several points to be be considered before using this PMTA against the US vaping market. Besides, recordkeeping, the application is hugely crippling to a young entrepreneurial, consumer invented supplemental alternative to smoking cigarettes. It is a relatively inexpensive, but highly regarded alternative to cigarettes for nicotine replacement. It will have a negative impact on those millions that have had great success with vaping, and especially those that produce them. I feel the imagination and creativity of those that were looking for a way to quit smoking have been exploited and 'stolen' from large tobacco conglomerates whose concern for public health has been zero, on any scale, while shareholder's money is their only motivation.Since cigarettes were marketed to the public, and tobacco executives testified that nicotine wasn't addictive, they have profited off poisoning the lungs of millions of people for decades. This PMTA will only solidify their US and world domination of cigarette illness and death. The death and disease suffered by cigarette smokers is why a Master Settlement Agreement was written, an admitted fact. Now, they stand to be the only ones that will profit from the solution to the damage caused by the product they sell! This is because the cost of the PMTA is unreasonable and will hinder further innovation by those that developed it and, tragically, shut most down. Many smaller companies and individuals that contributed to the early development of vaporized nicotine have already been side-lined, given up to bigger companies that could afford to become compliant with early FDA regulations.Eliquid companies spent millions of dollars rebuilding ISO8 clean rooms, changing bottles, using 'compliant' droppers, and providing CGGs to vape shops who are required to have them. Other developers were halted from innovation of new and safer mods and ENDS batteries.(Yet, global cigarettes companies aren't required to provide CGGs or other data sheets.) There were costly production of new packaging in plain, less 'kid' friendly eliquid sold in adult only vape shops, while shiny cigarettes packaging sit in every convenient store. Vaping is FDA regulated now, and since then, there has been no abrupt change in the manner in which our industry has conducted business, no new health risks, no accidental deaths or overdoses, and no pushback against the costly regulations already imposed.Before, and since, the FDA catagorized vaping nicotine as a tobacco product, and implemented costly regulations to a, supplemental, grassroots vaping market, there have still been millions of smokers who quit smoking, that would've otherwise died from it.Many have been able to completely quit smoking using vaping as an alternative, while some have cut down from it considerably.Unlike other industries that have to undergo new regulations due to a newly discovered danger, there have been no other precipitating factors, warnings, deaths, or injury that have caused an aggressive and unreasonably expensive new application. Not one sku, brand, strength or flavor of FDA-regulated commercially sold eliquid has been responsible for one death, or associated lung injury. There have been no injury from allergic reactions, overdoses, topical or oral injury to the skin, and yet the FDA is choosing to impose this expensive and debilitating process, called a PMTA, on an already regulated, safe, and submissive industry. In terms of a healthier supplement to deadly cigarettes, this only helps them. There is only one goal that the FDA can attain at this time as there have been no negative changes since the first regulations. US manufacturers, eliquid makers, an vape industry companies have complied with all of the earlier FDA regulations, there have been no vape industry related deaths or illness, and adult vape shops have complied with all state and federal laws, so the PMTA will only change who can and cannot afford to continue forward. As it is unreasonably expensive and burdensome for many, already, safe and compliant companies, only the biggest and richest conglomerates will survive. Tobacco giants that have already caused centuries of smoking related deaths,and lifetimes of sickness and disease will be the only ones to benefit and profit greatly. They profit on a worldwide market where the vape industry is becoming illegal. They profit domestically when and if it becomes an unreachable to the ones that developed it to counter their deadly produtct in the first place. They not only profit from monopolizing a market borne as a solution to the problems caused by their product, but profit from the destruction of further competition from the innovators that started it. There is no reason to push vaping over a cliff unless it's to secure the tobacco industry as the world leaders of death and disease and the pharmacuetical companies who profit from it.",death,Negative,Negative,Negative

The real failure of the current system is that it backs products like gum and patches, which have almost no realistic success rate at the 1 year mark. Vaping products are successful over the years. The perceived harms of vapor products is coming from misinformation spread, in haste, by media companies looking to cash in on clickbait articles and scary headlines. This is a public health tragedy, as tens of thousands of Americans have switched back to combustible tobacco, known and demonstrated to be more harmful that vapor products.The current PMTA process does not account for the damage implementing it will cause.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-1054,"My name is Lori Johnson, owner of Steep Slope Vape Supply. My business partner & I are the only employees of the company. We are a small business that exists for one reason-to help others stop smoking combustible cigarettes. We manufacture the Steep Slope brand of 35 flavors of eliquids which are registered with the FDA. We check the ID of every customer in our retail shop as well as thru our website. We are committed to keeping our products out of the hands of minors as well as not promoting nicotine products to minors thru our marketing, labels, packaging or the packaging of any other brands of eliquids we carry.As a very small company we cannot afford the estimated expenses associated with the PMTA process. There is no clear pathway designated by the FDA to navigate this process and as it stands now, any monies we invest would most likely be wasted. The base products we use (PG, VG, nicotine and flavors) are used by every other eliquid manufacturer in the world. Much research has proven that these individual products do not cause harm and it is ridiculous to require each individual manufacturer to prove thru expensive testing that these products are less harmful than combustible cigarettes. Traditional cigarettes KILL 50% of users eventually. The vaping industry is about harm reduction and trying to eliminate over 480,000 deaths a year in the US alone from smoking. To shut down the entire vaping industry is to miss the opportunity to stop the most preventable cause of death worldwide. The vaping industry is made up of small grassroots companies like ours who should be heralded as the best opportunity to improve public health that has ever challenged the tobacco industry. The FDA should be setting standards for products to be used in manufacturing eliquids, not making it impossible to get thru an unclear and expensive PMTA process. Requiring manufacturers to use USP grade PG, VG and nicotine as well as diacetyl free flavors; requiring recipes to be registered and requiring GMP standards for manufacture of eliquids along with appropriate licensing and inspections of manufacturing facilities would ensure safe products for the adult public. Appropriate fees to pay for these programs, fines and shutting down facilities who do not meet the standards similar to those in other industries would allow the vaping industry to continue providing high quality, safe products. There are already many laws against selling to minors and those should be enforced by the states and cities against vendors who sell to minors and the minors who are caught with the products. Teen use should not be the focus of the FDA beyond not allowing marketing to underage users whether it is via media or packaging. Restricting flavors will only prevent adults from switching to a less harmful alternative to cigarettes, not stop teen use. Prohibition encourages a dangerous unregulated blackmarket which is what has caused all the illnesses and deaths recently. You aren't saving kids by banning flavors, you are killing their parents and leading teens to combustible cigarette use. If parents switch to vaping and children don't see them smoking we will see a continued decrease in smoking rates and subsequent smoking related illnesses.I'm a former smoker who smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. My mom, dad and husband died from smoking related illnesses. My husband, who founded the company, died from stomach cancer that his doctors blamed on his previous years of smoking. By the time he switched to vaping, the damage was already done. I smoked menthol cigarettes, so when I started vaping I used menthol eliquid. However that just reminded me of what I was trying to get away from. I switched to fruity flavors and was finally able to stop using traditional cigarettes entirely. My daughter also stopped smoking using fruity and dessert flavors. We don't want to become another statistic and we definitely do not want the next generation to become smokers. I used 18mg strength eliquids when I first stopped smoking and have reduced the nicotine level I vape to 1.5mg with the goal being 0 nicotine. I vape much less than I used to and would eventually love to be free of the NEED to vape daily. We are thousands of small mom & pop businesses with a handful of employees each that have helped millions of people quit smoking. We work hard to support our families. This is our livelihood, our lifestyle and our passion. We will not be quiet when that is threatened, and we will fight government overreach by every available means to be able to save our lives and the lives of the people we love.

Please consider removing these impossible guidelines. As a small business with 247 Flavors registered on the FDA's website, it would cost us in excess of $240M.

Having a variety of options to customize a cessation program for a customer is what has contributed to their success. The ability to identify the right flavor, draw or throat hit and the right nicotine level are the biggest factors in converting a person off of combustible tobacco to vape. Keeping the current PTMA process in place will essentially run small to medium sized companies out of business and leave a monopoly for big tobacco and pharma. The vape companies controlled by big tobacco and pharma that created the teen vaping epidemic by marketing to teens and introduced the highest level nicotine in discreet devices will be the only ones left standing after PTMA's.

This will be devastating for consumers like me who use these products to make the life-changing switch away from cigarettes. When only a few of the tobacco harm reduction alternatives can afford to stay on the market, the choice is very limited and that can deter current and future smokers to make that switch away from cigarettes and force vapers who were smokers to return to smoking. As smoking tobacco is the #1 cause of preventable death in this country, it is imperative to allow as many less harmful vapor products as possible to be on the market to protect public health. Since the introduction of JUUL and the rise in youth vaping, nicotine content has been a point of contention. As far as I know, the only companies who have submitted their applications are the ones who carry products of high nicotine levels, such as 50mg/ml. However, most vapers like myself who use flavored nicotine vapor products are users of much lower nicotine levels, ranging from 36mg/ml to 3mg/ml and most of these products are manufactured by companies who cannot afford the PMTA process. Therefore, if the PMTA requirements remain unchanged, vapers like myself will be left with little or no tobacco harm reducing alternatives.

I tried everything to quite smoking. I tried the patches, gum, pills, etc. Nothing worked for me until I found vaping. It worked from day one. I was so impressed I decided I wanted to share this with other people. At the time I was a salesman for Frito Lay, and only had about four years left to retirement.

I employ three people full time besides myself, so I know we are not big enough for you to listen too. The PMTA process will put us out of business because of the costs. We are barely making it now thanks to the smear campaign you and the CDC did to our industry. I started this company to help people, and hopefully live the American dream everyone talks about.

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-1116,"I quit smoking cigarettes over 6 years ago with vaping. It literally took one day for me to easily make the transition with Cherry flavored e-liquid. Three days later, I felt the best I had in over 20 years of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. I was also mad that I had been robbed of great health for all those years. Hindsight is always 20/20, but as a teenager I had no idea what I was getting myself into with poisonous cigarettes.Over the course of happily vaping for years, I have become more physically active resulting in the loss of 40 extra pounds of weight. I've also gained muscle in the process. Something, I would have never accomplished with the extra 20 pounds of cigarette smoke sitting in my lungs.In high school, one of my teachers died half way through the school year due to lung cancer from smoking. Not a word was said to the kids warning them of the dangers. I was friends with my teachers teenager so I knew what happened, but the school wanted to keep it a secret. Ironically, It was the same year I started smoking.Now vaping is being blasted as a killer, but cigarettes are still o.k. It doesn't take a genius to see the corruption behind it all. Drinking anti-freeze is ok, but don't drink water..it's killing everybody.In my experience, the only thing killing people between the two is...cigarettes! I've never felt better, I can taste again, I don't stink, I can't burn anything down by accident (like my friend who fell asleep with a lit cigarette and burned down his house killing his dog). I don't hack up a lung every morning or sound like someones old grandma. I got my youthful voice back! I can run again, like when I was a kid and I'm 44 years old! I'm more motivated, I rarely get sick. Was constantly sick on cigarettes. My car windshield no longer has a nicotine tar residue on the inside.This witch-hunt is saturated in political MSA greed money. I get it. The states are accustomed to the money which they spend on things they want and not tobacco reduction campaigns.This still doesn't make it right to persecute the real health advocates of our day. Vapers are health advocates by nature. That's why we quit smoking and why we spread the word. Why we warn the public of dangerous products like black market THC cartridges when public officials refuse to.We are not bots, but real people trying to make a positive change in the world. #WeVapeWe",cost,Negative,Negative,Negative
FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-1118,"I am a member of a company that produces e-liquid products for wholesale to other vape companies and shops and also a member of separate company that currently operates 21 small vape shops in the northwest. Our shops are adult only and serves thousands of ex-smokers who have successfully quit smoking by switching to vaping. Our companies employ over 150 people. If the e-liquid company has to go through the PMTA process as it is currently structured, it will simply go out of business. The FDA it self estimates that each separate e-liquid application will cost at least $133,000 each, which from the estimates we have been receiving is about only one third of what the real cost will be. To get our e-liquids approved will cost the company over ten million dollars. We and the rest of the industry simply cannot afford this cost.Similarly, if flavored e-liquids are banned by the FDA or if the approved number of e-liquids are limited because of the cost, it will result in the closing of all our retail locations. Rather than ban flavors, their sale could be limited to age restricted locations like vape shops or segregated areas in other retail settings.The e-liquid manufacturers should not need to be required to separately prove that each separate e-liquid flavor provides a public health benefit and or reduced risks. The PMTA filed by Vuse for its e-liquid product flavors contains the same four ingredients that virtually all e-liquids contain. If the FDA were to approve the Vuse e-liquid products as reduced harm products with a public heath benefit, other e-liquid manufacturers should not need to have to prove the same thing over and over again. The same studies should be available for all e-liquid manufacturers to rely upon. The FDA needs to set out a separate path for e-liquid approval and applications based upon the fact that all the products are virtually the same. Forcing all e-liquid manufacturers to go through the PMTA process will destroy the independent vaping industry and in effect hand it over to the big tobacco companies that have the financial resources to pay for and complete the PMTA process as it is presently set out.The separate pathway should be modeled upon the system used in the UK. If e-liquids are approved by the FDA for sale to the public, the application process for substantially similar e-liquids should be a short application and reasonable fee. If someone desires to sell a new e-liquid in the UK, the total application fees and costs are usually less than $1,000. Once the FDA determines that e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes and a valuable harm reduction tool then the process to apply for substantially similar products should be simple and inexpensive. Under the process as it is set up now, an entire industry of 13,000 vape shops will be destroyed resulting in the unemployment of 150,000 people and the industry will be turned over to the tobacco companies that currently kill 500,000 Americans each year through smoking allowing them to continue sell cigarettes and corner the vaping market as well. Let the independent vaping industry compete with the tobacco companies on an even field by giving them a reasonable way to get their products approved by the FDA.",cost,Negative,Negative,Negative

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-1129,"I am against PMTA as currently written. PMTA is designed to turn over the multi billion dollar vaping industry to big tobacco. The high costs will put 100% of the small mom and pop eliquid manufactures out of business. Smoking rates will increase because the ensuing lack of flavor options for consumers will drive many back to smoking. I have heard estimates as high as $3,000,000 per SKU. These small eliquid manufacturing companies do not have this kind of money. Eliquid manufactures will close down as well as thousands of vape and smoke shops. Billions in taxes will be lost. Thousands of hard working Americans will become unemployed. These are Americans who help others quit smoking every day. PMTA as written will cause the price of e-liquid to sky rocket, that is if any remain on the market. Cigarettes will then look cheap. Only Big Tobacco will remain on the market. Perhaps that is the goal. I propose a better idea. A better idea is that the FDA use a method called Qualification By Similarity, to approve the flavors, as we use in the Aerospace industry. Base it on well known flavor suppliers used in the ingredients. There are only a handful of flavoring companies in the USA. All the manufactures Perfumers Apprentice, Capella, Flavor West, Flavor Art, Loranns, etc. The ratio of flavoring to PG, VG and nicotine used by eliquid manufacturers are roughly the similar. Twenty percent of smokers have quit smoking since 2005. This is all about states receiving a corresponding shrinking portion of their share of the Master Settlement Agreement (1998) money. States are panicking. Question, Do we want folks to quit smoking or not? Thank you.Best Regards,Mike DeighanSalt Lake City, Utah",eliquid,Negative,Negative,Negative

FDA-2019-N-2854,FDA-2019-N-2854-1132,"PMTA pathway as proposed will decimate small business in a disruptive and innovative marketplace that is proven to greatly benefit public health. Financially, the only businesses that could compete are big tobacco companies that value profits in any form over harm reduction. Restricting a technology that has the power and efficacy to end smoking in the US will set a terrible example for the rest of the world as they look to the US as an example. Sensible regulation should consider local and global implications in the interest of public health. In this instance, the UK TPD process provides a perfect example of meaningful regulation that allows for an open adult market while keeping underage use at a minimum. While the harm reduction benefits are widely accepted, regulators mistakenly assume a ban on flavors will eradicate teen initiation. A simple search on social media platforms will confirm that teens initiate use for the buzz, adults initiate use to quit smoking combustible cigarettes, and flavors are vital to their efforts. The glaringly obvious solution to ending teen use is to raise the legal nicotine use age to 21 in addition to restricting sale of all ENDS products to adult only age restricted establishments. Instead of burdening liquid manufacturers with unnecessary testing, a less costly and less labor intensive solution should set reasonable marketing and good manufacturing standards as well as impose stronger standards on ingredient (particularly nicotine) suppliers. If stronger regulations are imposed on ingredient suppliers, the number of regulatory submissions is greatly decreased, thus creating a more manageable workload for FDA, allowing for more effective enforcement at the root of the supply chain. On the precipice of ending the senseless death and disease caused by the sinister intentions of big tobacco companies, FDA has the opportunity to shape a regulatory landscape that fosters innovation and responsible manufacturing standards in tobacco harm reduction. PMTA, left as is, empowers the big tobacco death machine to continue claim 480,000 lives per year, while small businesses with an earnest passion for tobacco harm reduction become collateral damage causalities in a disastrous miscarriage of the protection of public health.",regulation,Negative,Negative,Negative
